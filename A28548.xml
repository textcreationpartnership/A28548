            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Long Retirement in the Country ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving afforded me many Hours of leiſure, I conſidered that I could not employ them better than in giving an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Dreſs to this Part of the Works of <hi>Boetius,</hi> intituled, <hi>Of the Conſolation of Philoſophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chaucer,</hi> the antient Poet of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was the firſt whom I find to have attempted a Tranſlation of this Book into our Tongue: but that is now almoſt as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible to the Engliſh Reader as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is; the Alterations of our Language, which he is ſaid, before any of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to have endeavoured to refine, having been very many and great ſince the times in which he flouriſhed. I have alſo ſeen two
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:56937:3"/>
other Tranſlations, the one of them publiſhed in the Year <hi>1609.</hi> The other only of four Books in that of <hi>1674,</hi> imprinted at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi> and though I ſhall not cenſure either of them, I may modeſtly ſay, that I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them which may hinder me from offering one to the Publick which may be more correct.</p>
            <p>In this ſmall but moſt admirable Book are to be found great Variety of Learning, many weighty Sentences, much well-digeſted Morality, and exact Rules for Life. This, and the other Works of our Author, ſhew him to have been a Man of comprehenſive Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of great Piety and Devotion; and his Conſtancy in Suffering makes him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have been of as great Vertue and Courage.</p>
            <p>He fell into ill Times, living when the Roman Empire was juſt expiring, being brought to its Period by the violent Irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſeveral Northern Nations which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down upon it like an impetuous Torrent; whoſe Force was not to be reſiſted, but did
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:56937:3"/>
carry all things before it; it being then the Cuſtom of thoſe People who lived North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, beyond the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Danow,</hi> born in an healthful and prolifick Climate, to abandon their native Countries when they were over-ſtock'd, (as they often happened to be) and to ſeek new Habitations.</p>
            <p>By this Means the Face of <hi>Italy</hi> (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of a great Part of <hi>Europe</hi>) was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with (Barbariſm; Arts and Civility were buried in their own Ruines, and all was ſubjected to the Will and Violence of bloody Conquerors.</p>
            <p>In the worſt of theſe Times this good Man endeavoured to maintain the Rights of his Country, and was the great Supporter of that ſmall Part of the Roman Liberty which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, deſiring nothing more than to ſee it one day reſtored: but it was not the Pleaſure of Heaven to grant his Deſire; it rather thought fit to permit him to fall into the Hands of his Tormentors, whoſe Perſecutions and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties only ended with his Life, and under the more barbarous Treatment of thoſe who gave
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:56937:4"/>
a Liberty to their Tongues (as appeareth in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of this Book) to traduce and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify his afflicted Vertue, to debaſe and decry his Sufferings, who handled his Wounds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Compaſſion; and who, by ſtabbing his Fame and Reputation, became more criminal than thoſe partial Judges who condemned him to Death, and more bloody than thoſe Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners who acted the Tragedy upon his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that we may find him to have been the Subject of Reflection and Diſcourſe to the Aſſemblies of the Pretenders to Policy, the Enquirers after and Tellers of News, who were generally the Knaves and Fools of his Country; and of thoſe mean-ſpirited Men who being at a Diſtance from the Dangers and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes with which he was oppreſs'd, thought they might ſafely paſs a Cenſure upon his Actions and Carriage, <hi>like Plowers plowing upon his Back, and making their Furrows long;</hi> and ſo, at his Expence, advance a little Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of Reputations to themſelves, by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perhaps, that their Demeanour ſhould
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:56937:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have been with more Firmneſs if they had been in his Circumſtances, when moſt of them had not Souls, calmly, to think upon what he with Conſtancy and Bravery did endure.</p>
            <p>It is true that this way of treating Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, though Good Men, as it had a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning long before the Times of <hi>Boetius,</hi> ſo daily Experience ſhews that it hath been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully continued ſince, even to our own, and will be carried on, doubtleſs, till all things ſhall have an End.</p>
            <p>He from whom Fortune hath withdrawn her kinder Influences, and upon whom thoſe who, under God, govern the World do not think fit to ſhine, whatever his Merits may have been before, will find himſelf expoſed to all the Injuries which his Superiours, Equals or Inferiours ſhall think good to heap upon him: <hi>He becometh a Reproof to all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but eſpecially amongſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; his Kinsfolks and Acquaintance ſtand far off him, and are afraid of him; and they who ſee him without do convey themſelves from him: He
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:56937:5"/>
becomes like a broken Veſſel, and is clean forgotten, like a dead Man out of Mind: He heareth the Blaſphemy of the Multitude,</hi> (which is always as ill-grounded as it is loud) <hi>and the Drunkards make Songs upon him.</hi> So that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation made by the ingenious and learned Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> in his Dedication before the Tranſlation of <hi>Juvenal, pag. 35, &amp; 36.</hi> appears to be very juſt, which is, that amongst Men, thoſe who are proſperouſly unjuſt are entituled to a Panegyrick, but afflicted Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is inſolently ſtabbed with all manner of Reproaches: No Decency is conſidered, no Fulſomneſs is omitted, no Venom is wanting ſo far as Dulneſs can ſupply it; for there is a perpetual Dearth of Wit, and Barrenneſs of good Senſe and Entertainment.</p>
            <p>But theſe are the ordinary Turns of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to which all Men ought to ſubmit; as thoſe who are endowed with Piety and good Senſe do with Willingneſs, ever making the right Uſe of them, without being ſurprized at them; becauſe they know that that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:56937:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is only to be found within themſelves, which others ſo anxiouſly hope and ſeek for from foreign Objects.</p>
            <p>This makes the worſt of Evils, Baniſhment or Death, to be endured with Chearfulneſs by Men of great Souls, they knowing that the Perſecution of this World is, to be the laſt Proof of their Patience and Fidelity; and that when that is at an end, their Vertue ſhall be rewarded and crowned.</p>
            <p>It now remains that I acquaint the Reader with the Deſign of this Book, and alſo that I ſay ſomething concerning my Performance upon it.</p>
            <p>Our Philoſopher here attempts to bring Man to a true Underſtanding of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Good of humane Minds; for ſome time after the Creation of the World he lived, and acted according to the Divine Rules and the Law of Nature: but being fallen into a State of Sin and Impiety, he ſoon loſt all his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and glorious Idea's and Forms, and was no longer cheriſhed with the kind Favours and Influences of Heaven as before he had been.
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:56937:6"/>
Yet notwithſtanding this unhappy Change, Vice had not ſo far obtain'd over Vertue, but humane Nature ſtill had a Knowledg (though much fainter) of God; it ſearched after him who gave to it a Being, and urged it ſelf on to deſire and purſue Happineſs. From hence it came to paſs, that the Sages and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of ſeveral Ages differed much in their Opinions concerning the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> or Sovereign Good, or Happineſs of humane Nature, as may be ſeen by their Writings, and the Hiſtories which make mention of them; which Opinions I need not now to enumerate, they being ſo well known. But we, whom God hath bleſſed with greater and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lights than Nature could afford, do now know well that our Happineſs can conſiſt in no other thing than in its Union with the Eternal Good: This being the higheſt Perfection of our Souls, it ought to incite us to purſue vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſo Exalted and Seraphick a State of Life; which leads us to thoſe Felicities which this World cannot ſhew. <hi>Boetius</hi> therefore here demonſtrates to us plainly, that there is
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:56937:6"/>
no ſubſtantial Happineſs in this World; that Riches, Honours, worldly Glory, or Pomp, can afford us none, but rather that we are tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with Uneaſineſs and Inquietude amidst our largeſt Enjoyments; that we can never be ſatisfied with any thing below that Eternal and Immortal Good which hath left ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of it ſelf upon every Creature; and that we muſt ſtrongly endeavour to ſettle our ſelves in the happy Condition of a Conjunction with the Eternal Being, and not ſtop in the Purſuit of it by repreſenting to our ſelves that humane Life is full of Miſeries, that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Vertue is afflicted and diſtreſſed, and that Wickedneſs is triumphant, and Impiety pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous. We are adviſed by him alſo to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God, who ever hath ruled, and will rule the World, will at laſt do Juſtice to thoſe who have lived according to his Precepts, and have been juſt and righteous, however they may have been perſecuted; and that he will ſhew in his own time that he maketh great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them, and thoſe who have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him by tranſgreſſing his Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:56937:7"/>It is here alſo ſhewn, that Death it ſelf, which ſeems ſo terrible to our Natures, doth only, after the Fatigues and Travels of the Day of Life, lay us, as it were, at Night to ſleep, that ſo our high and noble Faculties may be awaken'd to the Participation and Enjoyment of a more ſerene, free and happy Eſtate, which the Misfortunes of this World cannot affect, and which ſhall never have an End.</p>
            <p>This I take to be the Sum of what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Book of <hi>Boetius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now to advertiſe the Reader, that in my Tranſlation I have followed the Editions of <hi>Vallinus,</hi> and that of the Sieur <hi>Cally</hi> for the Uſe of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> becauſe I take them to be the moſt correct of any of thoſe which I have ſeen. In the Annotations alſo I have moſtly followed them, becauſe I have found them very learned and exact; but when I have made uſe of them, I have very much contracted them. I foreſee too, that it may be objected, that in them I ſeem to affect bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Learning, (which indeed I do not, nor ever did) and that thoſe Stories out of the
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:56937:7"/>
Poets and Mythologiſts, which ſwell the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, might have been omitted, becauſe they are commonly known. To this I anſwer, that I did not make this Tranſlation for the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that by Conſequence I could not intend to inform them, by my Notes and Illuſtrations, of any thing which they did not know before; but that I did think they might be inſtructive to the Engliſh Reader, and might make the Senſe of the Book more plain and pleaſant to him, for whoſe Uſe alone both the one and the other were deſigned.</p>
            <p>I know that Fault will alſo be found with the Liberty which I have taken in rendring of the Verſe, and with my own Additions which are in ſome Places made. To this I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that I have endeavoured, as well in tranſlating the Proſe as Verſe, not to omit any part of the Author's Senſe; and, to the beſt of my Underſtanding, I am ſure I have not: but, I think, ſince thoſe Tranſlations are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by all Men to be flat and inſipid, where the Words of the Author are too cloſely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, it muſt then be neceſſary that ſomething
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:56937:8"/>
ſhould be added or alter'd by the Tranſlator to heighten them, and to give them a more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Taſte, which is all I have pretended to do: But I muſt leave it to others to judg how well or how ill I have performed this.</p>
            <p>I have alſo rendred ſome <hi>Metres</hi> into blank Verſe, which may ſeem to ſome Readers to be an Effect of Lazineſs: But let the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers conſult the Original, and they will find that where-ever I have done it, the Subject and the Nature of the <hi>Metre</hi> is ſuch, that the Author's Senſe could not be clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the more confin'd way of Rithme.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF BOETIUS.</head>
            <p>ANICIUS MANLIUS SEVERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS BOETIUS was deſcended from an antient and noble Family, many of his Anceſtors having been Senators and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, and was born at <hi>Rome</hi> in that time when <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> the laſt of the Roman Emperors, (having for Fear reſign'd the Empire) was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and <hi>Odoacer</hi> King of the Herulians began to reign in <hi>Italy,</hi> about the Year of Chriſt CDLXXV, or a little after. His Grandfather ſeems to have been BOETIUS, a Conſular Man, who was Captain of the Guards to <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> and accompanied <hi>Aetius,</hi> that valiant Commander, in all his Expeditions, equally ſharing with him his Labours and Victories; and ſuffer'd for his ſake when he was kill'd by the Hand of the Emperor, who envy'd his Fame, and fear'd his Valour; with whom the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:56937:9"/>
Life, Safety, and Majeſty of the Weſtern Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire expired. His Father was ANICIUS MANLIUS FLAVIUS BOETIUS, Son of BOETIUS, mention'd above, who was Conſul in the Year CDLXXXVII. He dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when his Son was an Infant, his Friends and Relations took care of his Education, and ſent him to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he not only attain'd to a perfect underſtanding of the Greek Tongue, but alſo of Philoſophy, and of all other kinds of Sciences. Nor did he ſpend many Years in thoſe Studies, but with a wonderful Quickneſs he perfected himſelf in the Knowledg of all Arts and Diſciplines: Therefore returning young to <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſoon became the Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all there, and in ſhort time was advanc'd to the chief Dignities of his Country. Firſt he was admitted into the Rank of Senators: Next he obtain'd the Conſulate: and laſt of all, was made Maſter of the Offices. He had two Wives, the one nam'd <hi>Helpes;</hi> the other <hi>Ruſticiana:</hi> The firſt was a Sicilian by Birth; her Father's Name was <hi>Feſtus,</hi> at that time Chief of the Senate. Her Vertues, and the Endowments of her Mind, far exceeded her Beauty and Fortune: She excell'd in Poetry, and writ according to the moſt exact Rules of it, accompanying her Husband as a ſweet and inſpiring Genius, whilſt he compos'd ſome of his immortal Works. He deſired much to have
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:56937:9"/>

               <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:56937:10"/>His other Wife was <hi>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>STICIANA,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Quintus Aurelius Memius Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> who was alſo Chief of the Senate, and Conſul in the Year CDXXCV. By her he had many Children, two of which were Conſuls, viz. <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>INT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S ANICI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S SYMMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> and <hi>ANICI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S MANLI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S SEVERIN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S BOETI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> in the Year DXXII. this bearing the Name of his Father, the other of his Grandfather. <hi>Boetius</hi> well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that <hi>Symmachus,</hi> his Father-in-law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Heirs-male, he ſhou'd do a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to him if he gave his Name to his eldeſt Son by his Daughter. 'Tis likely that his Wealth was not ſmall, becauſe (beſides that he owns in his Writings, that he liv'd in great Plenty and Splendour, and that he had an Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Affluence of all worldly things) his Father ſupported the honourable Office of the Conſulate; and his Grandfather, in the moſt difficult times of the Empire, commanded the Pretorian Bands. Nor was he only conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by his Patrimony, for he had a great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to his Fortune by his Wife <hi>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>STICI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANA,</hi> to whom (and her Sons) the whole Eſtate of <hi>Symmachus</hi> did deſcend, ſince <hi>Galla,</hi> the other Daughter of <hi>Symmachus,</hi> upon the Death of her Husband, who died young, ſoon after the time of his Conſulſhip was expir'd, vow'd perpetual Chaſtity, and aſſociated her
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:56937:10"/>
ſelf to the Veſtals. To theſe Ornaments of Birth and Fortune Nature added alſo the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Faculties of Speaking and Writing; in which he ſo excell'd, that himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the firſt; and that the ſecond was not wanting to him, will appear to any one who examines what he has written upon the ſeveral Subjects of Mathematicks, Logick and Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But this Divine Work <hi>of the Conſolation of Philoſophy</hi> doth far exceed the reſt, for it abounds in various and difficult Arguments, and yields many choice Sentences and Rules of Life. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Subject which he attempts he does ſo acquit himſelf, that none can be ſaid to have taught more accurately, to have prov'd more irrefragably, or to have illuſtrated with more Perſpicuity. To be ſhort, he had ſo much Strength of Soul and Thought, and he ſhew'd ſo much Judgment in all his Managements, that even a moſt knowing Prince fear'd his Parts; and his Vertues and Integrity became his Crime, and wrought his Ruine. Theſe were the Cauſes of his Baniſhment and Death: With theſe he ſtudied to defend the good, and to curb and reſtrain ill Men, whenever it was in his Power: For whilſt he ſuſtain'd the Dignity of Maſter of the Offices (it being dangerous for him then to refuſe to do ſo) he was made Preſident of the Council, to whom it belong'd to overſee the Diſcipline of the Palace; and being Partaker
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:56937:11"/>
of many of the Secrets of his Prince, was call'd often to adviſe him in his weightieſt Affairs of State; and on all theſe Occaſions he gave great Proofs of his Abilities and inviolable Equity. Amongſt other of his generous and good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he defended <hi>Paulinus</hi> and <hi>Albinus,</hi> both Conſulars, and the Senate it ſelf, with the rich Province of <hi>Campania,</hi> againſt the Rapine and Violence of King <hi>Theodorick, Cyprian, Triguilla</hi> and <hi>Conigaſt;</hi> and alſo againſt the devouring Avarice of the Captain of the Guards, and other barbarous Spoilers. By theſe Proceedings he became the Object of ill Mens Hate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd alſo the Diſpleaſure of the King. But at this very time the Orthodox Emperor <hi>Juſtin,</hi> ſucceeding to <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Arian like a new Sun, enlightned the Oriental Regions with the Light of the true Faith: He confirm'd that Peace which was deſir'd by <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the Gothes, who then (<hi>Odoacer</hi> being ſlain) reign'd in <hi>Italy.</hi> He having reconcil'd the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and alſo ſeveral others, to <hi>Hormiſda</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did immediately, by his Edict, baniſh all Arians, except the Gothes, out of the Eaſtern Empire. <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the Goth was troubled at this Action above meaſure; however he diſſembled his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when behold three Informers, Men of deſperate Fortune, and worſe Lives, <hi>Gauden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Opilio,</hi> for ſeveral Offences being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:56937:11"/>
to Baniſhment, and <hi>Baſilius</hi> lately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd from being Steward of the King's Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and alſo much indebted, apply to the King and accuſe <hi>BOETI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> for that he ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Informer from bringing in his Witneſſes to prove the whole Senate guilty of Treaſon; that he declar'd his Deſign, by ſeveral Letters, of reſtoring the Liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi> and that he had endeavour'd to raiſe himſelf to Honours by magical Arts, and other unlawful Means. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorick</hi> jealous, as all are, of the Rights and Safety of his Crown, and fearing too that if the true Religion ſhould be aſſerted, the Romans, being more addicted to <hi>Juſtin,</hi> would attempt ſome Great thing, and knowing that what was done in the Eaſt againſt the Arians, was done at the Requeſt and in favour of <hi>Hormiſda</hi> and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Rome,</hi> did give ready Faith to thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, and immediately ſent them to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate at <hi>Rome,</hi> from which Place this good Man was then far diſtant, where they were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Accuſations, and to declare that the Lives and Safety of the Prince, and of all the Gothes, were now in great Jeopardy: So, to the Grief of all good Men, the innocent <hi>Boeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> abſent, unheard, and undefended, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Death, and to Proſcription. But the King fearing that Juſtice and all the World would have but too good Cauſe of Offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him if this Man ſhould die, he changed
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:56937:12"/>
his Sentence from Death to Baniſhment, that ſo he might be a Terror to other People; and he might ſtill have him in his Power to make a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of when his barbarous Soul ſhould thirſt after Blood. Therefore in the Year DXXII. he was baniſh'd to <hi>Milan,</hi> or (as others ſay) he was confin'd to <hi>Ticinum,</hi> now <hi>Pavia;</hi> and all his Friends and Relations were forbid to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him on his way, or to follow him thither. Being in that Place he writ this choice Piece <hi>of the Conſolation of Philoſophy,</hi> that he might in it declare his Innocence to Poſterity. Whilſt this learned and good Man was employed upon this Work, and endeavouring to reſtore unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by Philoſophy, that Contentment and Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of which his Enemies, by their Inſults and Injuries, had deprived him, <hi>Juſtin,</hi> in the Year DXXIV. did promulgate an Edict againſt the Arians, by which he commanded (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting even the Gothes) that all the Biſhops of that Opinion ſhould be depoſed, and that their Churches ſhould be conſecrate according to the true Chriſtian Form. The Gothes being every where baniſh'd from all Parts, apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Theodorick.</hi> He firſt by Letters treats with <hi>Juſtin</hi> to reſtore them to their Liberties and Privileges: But when he found he made no Progreſs by that way, he deſign'd an Embaſſy, and would make it more ſplendid and weighty by the Dignity of the Perſons to be ſent. <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:56937:12"/>
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> [which before that time was never done] and with him four of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular and Patritian Orders were ſent upon this Occaſion, and were commanded to addreſs to the Emperor, to repeal that Edict, by which he had exterminated the Arians; which if he did not ſpeedily do, then to declare that he would deſtroy <hi>Italy</hi> with Fire and Sword. The Ambaſſadors at their Arrival at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were receiv'd with all Reſpect and Joy, the Emperor, People and Clergy, going in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to meet them: <hi>John</hi> the Biſhop going to the Church took the upper Hand, and ſitting on the Throne on the right Hand, he celebrated the Day of the Reſurrection of our Saviour after the Roman Uſe, and crown'd <hi>Juſtin</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. <hi>Theodorick</hi> did not well digeſt thoſe great Honours done to his Ambaſſadors, but he did not expreſs his Diſcontent till the Gothes by their Letters complain'd to him, that <hi>John,</hi> in contempt of his Inſtructions, had conſecrated the Arian Churches after the Roman way. Then believing himſelf not only contemn'd but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd, he began to rage and threaten, and to meditate Revenge. Nor did he long conſider of the way: For on the tenth of the Kalends of <hi>November,</hi> in the Year of Chriſt DXXV. [and of his Baniſhment the fourth] by a Sword he open'd the way of Immortality to <hi>Boetius.</hi> There want not ſome who ſay, that the King raging
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:56937:13"/>
much when he heard the News from <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> did not, as before, think this a feigned, but did now believe it as a real and true Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy: And that he did admoniſh <hi>Boetius</hi> by the Tribune (to whom he had committed the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution) that if he did deſire or hope for Mercy at his Hands, he would diſcloſe the whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in all its Methods and Circumſtances. But he (as he might well do) inſiſting upon his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, receiv'd the fatal Blow. As to what relates to <hi>Symmachus,</hi> 'tis reported that he was ſent for to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and was there long detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in cuſtody. <hi>John,</hi> with his Collegues, about this time return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> when he found his Friend <hi>Boetius</hi> dead; <hi>Italy</hi> groaning under Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Miſery, and in vain ſtrugling with her Chain; the King raging and furious, and Barbarity every where reigning: he ſtay'd ſome little time at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at length was perſwaded by <hi>Theodorick,</hi> who had put on a Vizard of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and Mildneſs (though his Friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to the contrary) to go to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> accompanied with others; whom, as ſoon as they were arriv'd, he deliver'd to ſeveral Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and puniſh'd by ſeveral ways: <hi>John</hi> was put into a low Dungeon, where he was ſoon overcome by Hunger, and the Horror and Stench of the Place, and died the 6th of the Kalends of <hi>June:</hi> on the Day after the Death of this holy Man <hi>Symmachus</hi> was murder'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:56937:13"/>
undergone no legal Trial. Nor had the Rage of the Tyrant ended here; for he alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd upon the Lives of ſeveral others of the Patritians, if he had not been deterr'd from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further by the Fear which he was under of the Reſentments of the Orthodox Emperor <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi> The Body of <hi>John</hi> was tranſlated from <hi>Ravenna</hi> with much Pomp and Solemnity, and was received by the Clergy and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> on the Kalends of <hi>June,</hi> with all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies due to Martyrdom. But the ſame Honours could not be done to the Bodies of <hi>Boetius</hi> and <hi>Symmachus,</hi> though they had receiv'd the ſame Crown and Palm, for the King commanded that they ſhould be hidden in the moſt private Place that could be found. (Nor did <hi>Theodorick</hi> long ſurvive this barbarous Action, the Revenge of Heaven always purſuing and overtaking Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, when that of Men cannot; for in a few Days after the Head of a great Fiſh being ſerv'd up to him at Supper, <hi>Symmachus,</hi> who was by his Command lately ſlain, ſeem'd fiercely to threaten him out of it, with his Teeth and Eyes; with which terrible Sight being ſtricken and amaz'd, he trembling and cold, took his Bed and died, having firſt with Tears expreſs'd and teſtified his Grief for the Death of <hi>Boetius</hi> and <hi>Symmachus,</hi> to <hi>Elpidius</hi> his Phyſician, then preſent. <hi>Amala Sunta,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorick,</hi> ſucceeding to her Father in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:56937:14"/>
and knowing well what had happen'd to him at his Death, did ſoon reſcind what her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done contrary to Right and Juſtice, and did reſtore the Eſtates and Goods of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Children of <hi>Boetius</hi> and <hi>Symmachus,</hi> which before had been confiſcate to the Uſe of the King. The Religious of thoſe Days did then decree the uſual Honours to both of their Memories; and at this Day <hi>Boetius</hi> at <hi>Pavia</hi> on the 10th of the Kalends of <hi>November,</hi> and <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> at <hi>Ravenna</hi> on the 5th of the Kalends of <hi>June,</hi> are commemorated with much Devotion, becauſe they died in the maintenance of the true Faith againſt the impious and heretical Doctrines of <hi>Arius.</hi> The Tomb of <hi>Boetius</hi> is to be ſeen at this Day in the Church of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> near to the Steps of the Chancel, with the following Epitaph:

Next, he complains of his many Injuries, and the Loſs of his Reputation and Dignities.

many irkſome Labours and Enquiries after Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom deſerv'd this? or becauſe my Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was before determined, ſhall it qualify theſe Men to be my Accuſers? Is not Fortune aſhamed; if not of the Accuſation of injur'd Innocence, at leaſt of the Baſeneſs and Infamy of its Accuſers? But perhaps you may ask, what Crime is objected to me?

Why, 'tis urg'd, that I hinder'd an Informer from carrying Proofs to the King, which ſhould have declared the whole Senate to have been guilty of Treaſon? And now, O my Miſtreſs! what think you? ſhall I deny the Crime that I may not be a Reproach to thee? No, it was always my Deſire to preſerve that Auguſt Body in its Splendor, and in its juſt Rights, and it ſhall be ſo to the laſt Moment of my Life. Shall I confeſs it?

But Folly, which always flatters it ſelf, cannot change the Merit of things: Nor do I think it lawful, according to the Judgment of <hi>Socrates,</hi> either to hide the Truth, or own a Falſity.

what is ſhe, being ſo ready to take her Flight, but a ſure Preſage of future Calamity? But it is not enough to behold thoſe Objects which are placed before our Eyes; for Wiſdom hath a Proſpect to the End and Event of things; and Fortune often changing from Adverſe to Proſperous, and from Proſperous to Adverſe, ſhould make Men neither fear her Threats, nor deſire her Favours. To be ſhort, thou muſt with Patience and Equality of Soul, bear whatever is acted by her upon the Scene of this World, when thou haſt once ſubmitted thy Neck to her ponderous Yoke: For if thou doſt pretend to preſcribe a certain time of Adobe and Receſs to her, whom thou haſt freely, and of thine own Accord, choſen to be thy Soveraign and Miſtreſs, art thou not injurious to her? and doſt thou not, by Impatience, imbitter thy Lot, too hard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which thou canſt not alter by thy moſt vigorous Efforts?

Firſt; Why, O Man! doſt thou by thy daily Complaints accuſe me as guilty? What Injury have I done to thee? What Goods or Advantages have I withdrawn from thee? Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead me before what Judg thou pleaſeſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Poſſeſſion of Wealth and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and if thou canſt prove that ever any Man had a true and fix'd Propriety in them, I will then readily grant, that thoſe things were thine which thou doſt ſo earneſtly deſire to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thee. When Nature firſt brought thee

out of the Womb into this World, I received thee naked, neceſſitous, and ſtripp'd of all things, and (which now is the Cauſe of thy Impatience againſt me) I indulgently educated thee, I heaped my Bleſſings upon thee, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed thee with Glory and Splendor, and with an Affluence of all things which were in my Power; now when I have a mind to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my Bounty, and to ſtop the Current of my Favours, be thankful for the Uſe of that which was not properly thine. Thou haſt no juſt Cauſe of Complaint, for thou haſt loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which was thy own: Why then doſt thou mourn? I have done thee no Wrong. Riches, Honours, and all other things of that kind, are ſubject to me, and in my Power; they are my Servants, and acknowledg me their Miſtreſs; they come with me, and when I depart they follow. I dare boldly affirm, that if thoſe things (the want of which thou doſt now deplore) had been thine own, thou hadſt not loſt them: Shall I alone be forbid to exerciſe my own Power, and to uſe my own Right? Heaven takes the liberty to bleſs the World with fair and ſunny Days, and again to vail them in dark and cloudy Nights.

                  <p>That thou doſt yet groan under the Torment of thy ill-grounded Opinion, is not to be imputed to the evil Eſtate of thy Affairs; for if this empty Name of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Happineſs moves thee, do but recollect with me, what Plenty thou enjoyeſt, and what is yet reſerved ſafe to thee: And therefore if thou yet doſt poſſeſs that which in the beſt times thou didſt account moſt precious, it being yet by the Hand of Heaven preſerved ſafe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate, canſt thou juſtly then complain of the Injuries of Fortune? <hi>Symmachus</hi> thy Father-in-law,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56937:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Delight and Ornament of Mankind, whoſe Welfare thou wouldſt readily purchaſe at the rate of thy Life; one, who by an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Temper and Mixture is wholly made up of Wiſdom and Vertue, is yet ſafe, and fearleſs of his own Concerns; only laments thy Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and grieves for thy Misfortunes. Thy Wife yet lives an Example of Modeſty, and a Pattern of Chaſtity; and that I may in one Word include all her Endowments and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, the true Reſemblance of her Father: She lives, I ſay, and being weary of Life, breaths only for thy ſake, and (in which thing alone I will yield that thy Happineſs receives Diminution) ſhe pines away with Grief and Tears, and with the Deſire of once more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying thy ſweet Converſation. Why ſhould I mention thy Conſular Sons, in whom, being yet ſo young, ſo much of the Wit and Spirit of the Grand-father and Father doth ſhine? Since then it is the chief Care of Men to preſerve Life, thou art moſt happy, if thou wouldſt but know it, to whom ſo many Advantages and Bleſſings yet remain, which all Men value above Life. Wherefore dry up thy Tears, Fortune hath not expreſſed her Rage and Malice againſt you all; nor hath the Tempeſt been too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, whilſt thy Anchors yet hold, and afford to thee Cauſe of preſent Comfort, and Hope of future Felicity.</p>

                  <p>I ſhould think that we had made a good Advance, if thou didſt not yet retain a Concern for the Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy former Eſtate. But I cannot ſuffer that thou ſhouldeſt, with ſo much Delight, mention thy Fortunes, and in ſo much Anxiety bewail the Loſs of ſo ſmall a part of them: For whoſe Felicity is ſo well grounded, who hath not in ſome things cauſe to quarrel with his Lot? The Condition of humane Goods is anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inconſtant; for either they do not all at once arrive, or if they do, they make no ſtay with us. One Man is bleſſed with a great Afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Wealth, but he is aſhamed of the Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Blood. The Nobility of that Man's Deſcent makes him conſpicuous, but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy within the Bounds of a narrow Eſtate, and ſo unable to bear up the Port of his Anceſtors, he had rather live retired and unknown. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abounds with Wealth, and is nobly born too, but he is unmarried, and to compleat his Happineſs he would have a Wife. Another is happy in Wedlock, but he wants Children, and is troubled that he muſt gather Riches for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Heir. Another hath the Joy of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children, but is ſoon again mortified by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56937:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the evil Courſes which they take. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we fee, that no Man can eaſily agree with the State of his Fortune; for in all Conditions there is ſomething which, untry'd, a Man doth not know, and which after trial he doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. Add alſo to this, that the Senſes of the Happy are refined and delicate; and unleſs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing happens to them as they deſire, or when it pleaſeth them, they are impatient: He who is not uſed to Adverſity, is overcome and thrown down by every croſs Adventure; and the leaſt evil Acccidents diſcompoſe him: upon ſo minute and ſlender things doth the Happineſs of the moſt Fortunate depend. How many Men are there in the World, doſt thou believe, who would think themſelves advanced almoſt to Heaven, if they could attain but to the leaſt part of the Remainder of thy Fortunes? This very Place, which thou calleſt a Place of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, is their Country who inhabit it: And thy Miſeries ariſe only from the ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Opinion that thou art miſerable. And again, every Lot may be happy to that Man who can with Equanimity and Courage bear it. Who is he ſo happy, who when once he grows impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, doth not deſire to change his State of Life? How much is humane Felicity imbittered! which though it may ſeem ſweet to the Enjoyer, yet is not to be retained, but when it pleaſeth takes its Flight? So that hence it may appear;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56937:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how miſerable even the greateſt Felicity of Men is, ſince it will not remain with thoſe, who with Equality bear every kind of Lot, nor will bring Comfort to thoſe whoſe Minds are anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and oppreſſed. Why therefore, O wretched Mortals, do ye ſo induſtriouſly ſeek abroad for that Felicity which is placed at home within your ſelves? Error and Ignorance miſlead and confound you. But I, in ſhort, will ſhew you the very Hinge upon which the trueſt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth turn. Is there any thing more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and eſtimable to thee than thy ſelf? No, thou wilt ſay. Then if thou wilt weigh things well, and gain the Command over thy ſelf, thou wilt poſſeſs that which thou wouldſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſe, and which Fortune can never take from thee. And that thou mayſt ſee that Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude cannot conſiſt in thoſe things which are in the Power of Fortune, only conſider thus; If Happineſs be the Sovereign Good of Nature, living and ſubſiſting by Reaſon, then that thing cannot be it, which can by any means be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from us, becauſe that which cannot be taken away is worthily eſteemed the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Hence it appears that Inſtability of Fortune is not ſuſceptive of true Happineſs. Add to this, that he who is carried away by fading Felicity, doth either know that it is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or he doth not. If he knows it not, what Happineſs can he take in the Blindneſs of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56937:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Ignorance? If he knows it, he muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be afraid leſt he ſhould loſe that which he knows is eaſily to be loſt; and in that caſe his continual Fear will not ſuffer him to be happy. Perhaps he cares not if he ſhould loſe it, and he would not be much troubled at its Loſs. Even truly the Good is but very ſmall and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Loſs of which a Man can bear with ſuch Equanimity and Unconcernedneſs. And becauſe I know that thou art one who haſt been fully perſwaded, and by many Demonſtrations convinced of the Immortality of the Souls of Men; it alſo being evident that the Goods of Fortune receive a Period with our Bodies by Death; it cannot then be doubted but if Death can put an end to our Happineſs, that all Men, when they die, are plunged into the Depths of Miſery. And ſince we know well, that many Men have endeavoured to obtain Felicity, not only by undergoing Death, but by ſuffering the moſt cruel Pains and Torments, how then can it be imagined that this preſent Life can make Men truly happy, ſince, when it is ended, Men do not become miſerable?</p>

                  <p>BUT foraſmuch as the Applications of my Reaſons have ſunk into thee, I think it is now time to uſe ſome more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Medicines: Go to then, if the Gifts of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were not fading and momentary, as they are, what is there to be found in them which may, at any time, be accounted thine? or which, if it be thorowly conſidered and looked into, will not appear to be vile and unworthy? Are Riches in their own Nature, or by the Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men, pretious? What ſort of Riches is moſt excellent? Gold, or a great Maſs of Silver gathered together? But this appears more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by ſpending it, than by treaſuring it up; for Avarice always makes Men odious, and Bounty makes them famous and renowned. And if that which is conferr'd upon another cannot continue with any Man, then certainly is Money moſt pretious when it is tranſlated to others; and ceaſes to be poſſeſs'd by him who hath given it. If all the Money that is in all Parts of the World were gathered into one Hand, the reſt of Mankind would be needful and want it. The Sound of a Voice, if it be entire, and not obſtructed by any <hi>Medium,</hi> doth at the ſame time fill the Ears of many People;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56937:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but Riches, unleſs they be diminiſhed and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd, cannot meet the Neceſſities of many; and that being done, they whom they have left muſt unavoidably ſubmit to Poverty. O therefore (may I juſtly ſay) narrow, mean, and even poor Riches! which cannot all be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by many at the ſame time, and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be poſſeſs'd by one, without impoveriſhing and ruining the reſt of Mankind! Doth the Brightneſs of Jewels attract the Eye? But if there be any thing extraordinary in their Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, it is the Brightneſs of the Stones, and not of the Eye which beholds them; therefore I very much wonder that Men ſhould admire them: For what is it which wants the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Motions of a Soul, and the Contexture of Joints, which can really ſeem beautiful to a rational Nature? For although from the Hand of the great Workman, and for Diſtinction's ſake, they have derived ſomething of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Grace and Beauty, yet they are placed below thy Excellence, and by no means wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to attract thy Admiration.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56937:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Splendor of theſe things? Art thou embeliſhed, or any way diſtinguiſhed by the Flowers of the Spring? or doth thy Plenty ſwell in the fruitful Face of Summer? Why art thou carried away with empty Joys? Why doſt thou embrace that Good which is out of thy Power? for Fortune can never make that thine, which the Nature of things forbid to be ſo. The Fruits of the Earth are doubtleſs for the Nouriſhment of living Creatures; and if thou wouldſt confine thy ſelf to the ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only of the Neceſſities of Nature, thou wouldſt not ſo much ſeek after the Affluence and Gifts of Fortune: For Nature is ſatisfied with few things, and thoſe the leaſt: And if thou doſt, after ſuch Satiety, overcharge her with Superfluities, that which thou doſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradd, becomes either unpleaſant or hurtful to her. To proceed, doſt thou think that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends thee to the World to ſhine in Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of coſtly Clothes? the Sight of which, if it be grateful to the Eye, the Matter or the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the Workman is to be admired. Doth a great Retinue, and the Attendance of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Train of Servants, make thee happy? If thoſe Servants be vitious, they are a great Burden to the Houſe, and pernicious Enemies to the Maſter of it. But if they be good, why ſhould the Vertue and Goodneſs of others be put to thy Account? From all which it plainly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56937:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
appears, that none of theſe which thou didſt number among thy own Goods, were really to be eſteemed ſo. In which, if there be no things deſirable, what Reaſon is there that thou ſhouldſt grieve for the loſs of them, or rejoice at their poſſeſſion? If they are fair or beautiful by Nature, what doth that concern thee? For ſo by themſelves, wholly ſequeſtred from thy Riches, they would pleaſe: They therefore are not to be eſteemed pretious becauſe they are numbred amongſt thy Goods, but becauſe they ſeemed ſo before thou wert deſirous to poſſeſs them. What is it then, that with ſo much Noiſe, and ſo much Addreſs, we deſire of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune? It is, perhaps, to drive away the Fear of Poverty by a general Affluence of Wealth; but this often happens otherwiſe: for there is great need of many Helps even to keep ſo great an Acceſſion of Furniture, and Variety of things after they are obtained: And it is moſt true, that they want moſt things who poſſeſs the moſt: And on the other ſide, they want the feweſt who meaſure their Abundance by the Neceſſities of Nature, and not by the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of Excentrick and irregular Deſires. Is it ſo then, that Men have no proper and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Good planted within them, but that they muſt be forced to go abroad to ſeek it? Are things ſo changed, that Man, that excellent Creature, whoſe Reaſon almoſt entitles him to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56937:51"/>
Divinity, can be no other way ſenſible of his own Glories, than by the poſſeſſion of ſoul-leſs and unneceſſary things? All other Beings are content with their own Endowments, and you only (who are the Image of God) vainly ſeek acceſſional Ornaments for your excelling Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from things placed ſo much below you, not underſtanding how great an Injury you do by it to your Maker. He ordained the Race of Men to excel all other earthly Creatures; and you depreſs your Dignity and Prerogative below the loweſt Beings. For if that Good which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to any thing be more pretious and worthy than that thing to which it belongs, ſince you eſteem'd the moſt contemptible things to be your Good, you ſubmit your ſelf, by that your Eſteem, to them, and take the lower Place: And this is but what you deſerve. For ſuch is the Nature of Man, that he doth then only excel other Beings, when he knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But he may be ranked below the Beaſts that periſh, when he once ſlights that neceſſary and important Knowledg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For ſuch Ignorance is natural to other Creatures; but to Man it is unnatural and a Vice. How weak and open an Error is it in Men, who imagine that any thing which is foreign to their Natures, can be an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to them? That cannot in Reality be ſo; for if any thing look bright and glorious with that which is put upon it, that which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56937:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is ſaid to ſhine, and is admired; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the thing covered ſtill continues in its natural Impurity and Diſeſteem. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deny that thing to be good which is hurtful to him who poſſeſſes it. Am I deceived in this? Thou wilt ſay, no; for Riches have often hurt their Poſſeſſors, ſince every ill Man is the more deſirous of other Mens Riches, and he thinketh him alone who is in poſſeſſion of ſuch things, to be a Man of Worth, and to be eſteemed. Thou therefore who now ſo much feareſt to be aſſaulted by the Spear or the Sword, if thou hadſt entred into the Path of this Life not incumbred with Riches, thou mightſt, like the way-faring Man, with an empty Purſe have ſung before the Robbers. The Happineſs then derived from fading Riches is glorious indeed and great; by the poſſeſſion of which a Man loſeth his Security and Quiet.</p>

things do not uſe to unite; and Nature forbids that contrary things ſhould join: So that ſeeing wicked Men do often execute Offices of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Truſt, it appears that they are not good in themſelves, becauſe they can reſide in ſuch Subjects. The ſame may alſo be moſt juſtly ſaid of all the Gifts of Fortune which are moſt commonly ſhewed in greateſt Plenty upon the worſt of Men. It ought alſo to be conſidered, that no Man doubteth him to be valiant, in whom he hath ſeen the Vertue of Fortitude ſhine: nor him to be ſwift of foot, in whom he hath ſeen Swiftneſs. So Muſick maketh a a Muſician; the Science of Phyſick a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician; and Rhetorick a Rhetorician. The Nature of every thing acts properly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its End, nor is mix'd with foreign Effects of differing Beings, but of its own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord repels what is contrariant to it, or may be deſtructive of it. Riches cannot extinguiſh the unquenchable Thirſt of Avarice; nor can Power give him Command of himſelf, who is already the Slave of his Vices, and bound in the inſoluble Chains of his Luſts. So Dignities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon ill Men do not only not make them worthy, but rather ſhew their Unworthineſs by laying them open, and diſcovering their Shame.

laid open, and appear by the Effects of thoſe very things: ſo that even theſe Riches, and this Power, and that Dignity, ought not of right to be called by thoſe Names. And laſtly, the ſame thing may be ſaid of all the Gifts of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, in which it is manifeſt, that nothing is deſirable, nor is there any thing of native Good in them, ſince they are not always the Lot of good Men, nor make them good to whom they are allotted.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56937:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſmall, and how truly void of Weight even that is, do but from hence obſerve: Thou haſt learnt from Aſtrological Demonſtrations, that the whole Circuit of the Earth bears the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion only of a Point to the Greatneſs of the Heaven; that is, if it be compar'd to the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the Celeſtial Globe, it may be judged to have no Space or Compaſs. And of this ſmall Region of the World, almoſt the fourth Part is inhabited by living Creatures, known to us, as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath ſeemed to prove. And if thou ſhalt abate alſo all which is overflown by the Sea, and Marſhes, and Lakes, and alſo all that Space of the Globe which is deſart and overſpread with Sands, or burnt up by the too near Vicinity of the Sun, thou wilt find that what is left for the Habitation of Men, is but a very ſmall Proportion. And do you who are placed in, and confined to the leaſt Point of this Point, think of nothing but of propagating your Fame, and exerting your Names, and making your ſelves renowned? What is there auguſt or magnificent in Glory, confined to ſo ſmall and narrow Bounds? Add to this, that this little Encloſure is inhabited by ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions differing in Tongue, in Manners, and in way of Life: to whom, as well by reaſon of the Difficulties and Inconveniencies of Journy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as by the Diverſity of Languages, and the Unfrequency of Commerce, not only the Fame
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56937:58"/>
of particular Men, but even the Names of great Cities, cannot arrive. In the time of <hi>Marcus Tullius,</hi> as himſelf in his Writings tells us, the Fame of the Roman Common-wealth, which was then well grown and robuſt, and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Parthians and ſeveral other Nations in theſe Parts, was not yet known to thoſe who inhabited beyond the Mountain <hi>Caucaſus.</hi> Thou ſeeſt then how narrow and ſtrait that Glory is which thou laboureſt ſo much to propagate and dilate. Doſt thou think that the Glories of a Roman Man ſhall reach thoſe Places where the Fame and Story of the illuſtrious Roman Common-wealth would never reach? Do not the Cuſtoms and Inſtitutions of ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries diſagree among themſelves; ſo that that which with ſome is adjudged to be Praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, with others is thought to deſerve Diſgrace and Puniſhment. Hence it appears, that it is not the Intereſt of any Man who deſires Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, to have his Name ſpread through many Countries, and divers People, but that he ſhould be content with that Glory and Fame which he can arrive at amongſt his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and not care to have the Immortality of it extended beyond the Bounds of one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But how many Men, great and famous in their Generations, hath the Careleſneſs and Neglect of Writers paſſed by in Silence? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed one may juſtly ask, what can
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56937:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuch Memorials profit a Man, which with their Authors muſt at length yield to the Powers of Age, and be with them buried in Oblivion? But Men imagine that they have obtained Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality if their Names ſhall but live in future Ages. But if they would compare this to the infinite Progreſs of Eternity, what have they which ſhould make them pleaſed at the Diuturnity of their Fame? For if the Duration of one Moment be compared with that of ten thouſand Years, the Spaces of both being defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it hath ſome, though a very little Portion of it. (But yet this very Number of Years, and as many more as can by Numbers be multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cannot at all be compared to endleſs Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: For there may be ſome Compariſon betwixt finite Beings amongſt themſelves, but there can be none at all betwixt Infinite and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Hence it is that Fame (however durable and laſting) conſidered with infinite Eternity, will ſeem not only to be little, but indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But you think you cannot do well, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you have the empty Applauſe of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and forgoing the Pleaſures of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the Conſideration of the innate Worth of Vertue, and the Pleaſure of Actions reſulting from it, you look for a Reward from the partial Breath, and vain Diſcourſes of the <hi>Many.</hi> Obſerve now how one once ingeniouſly plaid upon the Lightneſs and Folly of ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance.

A certain Perſon accoſted another with contumelious Language, who had aſſumed to himſelf the Name of a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> not out of a Principle of Vertue, but for the itch of Vain-glory: and he added, that he ſhould now know if he were a true Philoſopher, by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patiently the Injuries offered to him; he putting on for a while a counterfeit Patience, ſaid then to the other, Doſt thou now believe me to be a Philoſopher? He anſwered ſmartly again, I had indeed believed it, if thou couldſt ſtill have held thy Tongue. What then is it that great and worthy Men (for of ſuch I ſpeak) who would by vertuous ways acquire Glory; what is it (I ſay) of Advantage which they receive by a great Name after the Body is reſolved into Duſt? For if (which our Reaſon and Religion forbids us to believe) the whole Fabrick of Man, Body and Soul, is diſſolv'd, and dies together, then is there no Glory; nor can there be when he (to whom it belongs) doth no more exiſt. But if the Soul which hath deſerved well, when it's enlarg'd from its earthly Priſon, doth take a ſwift and unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd Flight to Heaven, will it not deſpiſe the Earth and its Buſineſſes; and being wrapt in the Joys of Heaven, rejoice that it is wholly exempt from ſublunary Conſiderations and Concerns?</p>

               <p>Philoſophy now urgeth ſtronger Arguments, to wit, that all Men do ſeek after Happineſs; but that they do very much err in the way of obtaining it, whilſt ſome believe to find it in Riches, others in Dignities, in the Favour of Kings, in the Glory of great Atchievements, in Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or in the Pleaſures of the Body: She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates clearly, that it is in none of theſe, becauſe they are ſo far from being to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Goods, that they are accompanied with a great many Evils; but in God, who is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and only Good, and that by his Order the World is governed.</p>

               <p>BY this time ſhe had ended her Song, when I, deſirous to hear more, was ſo charmed by the pleaſantneſs of it, that I ſtood long expecting that ſhe would proceed: but at laſt ſaid I, O thou chief Support and Stay of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Minds, how much haſt thou refreſhed me either with the weight of thy Sentences or the ſweetneſs of thy Numbers! ſo that now I almoſt think my ſelf an equal Match for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and able to reſiſt her Blows. Therefore I do not only not fear the Applications of thoſe Remedies, which thou didſt ſay a little before were ſharp, but I earneſtly deſire to hear what they are. I well perceived that, returned ſhe, when with ſilence and attention thou didſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Words; and I did then expect ſuch a State of Mind in thee, or what is more true, I did then create in thee ſuch an one. And indeed what yet remains to be ſaid is of ſuch a Nature, that when it is firſt taſted, it ſeems to bite, and is unpleaſant; but when it is once ſwallowed it turns ſweet, and is moſt grateful to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. But becauſe thou ſayſt thou wouldſt now gladly hear, with what Deſire wouldſt thou burn, if thou couldſt imagine whither I am now about to lead thee? Whither is that I

pray thee? (ſaid I). To that true genuine Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, anſwered ſhe, which thy Mind doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend as if it were in a Dream, and of which thou ſeemeſt to have ſome Foretaſte. But thy Sight is ſo clouded with falſe Forms, and light Appearances, that it cannot bear the Luſtre of that Object. Then I intreat thee without Delay, ſhew me that true Happineſs. I will moſt willingly, at thy Deſire, do it, replied ſhe: but I will endeavour to deſcribe that falſe and adulterate Cauſe which is better known to thee; and that being fully laid open, thou wilt be better able to comprehend that exact Model of true Felicity which I ſhall draw by caſting thine Eye upon its contrary.</p>

               <p>THEN fixing her Eye a little, and as it were withdrawing her ſelf into the moſt inward Cabinet of her Mind, ſhe thus began; All the Care and manifold Studies of Men do indeed proceed in differing Paths, but they tend to one only End, which is Happineſs: And Happineſs is that compleat Good, of which when a Man is once poſſeſſed, he hath nothing more to deſire. This indeed is the Sovereign
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56937:64"/>
Good of all, and contains all others in it: To which, if any thing were wanting, it could not be the chief, becauſe there would be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without it ſelf, ſome foreign Advantage which were to be deſired. It is therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that Bleſſedneſs or Happineſs is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State in which all other Goods meet and centre; which, as I have ſaid, all Men endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to arrive at by differing Ways and Means: For in the Minds of Men there is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted a Deſire of the true Good, but wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Error leads them to the falſe and fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one; ſo that ſome, believing it to be the chief of Goods to want nothing, labour for an abundance of Riches: Others again believing Happineſs to conſiſt in being reverenced and eſteemed by their Country-men, endeavour all they can after Honours. There are alſo thoſe who place it in Power, and theſe endeavour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to rule themſelves, or to be Favourites to thoſe who actually govern. There are thoſe alſo who fancy an high Renown to be the height of Happineſs; and theſe, by all the Arts of War and Peace, haſten to propagate their Names, and to arrive at Glory. Many mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Fruits of this Good by Joy and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and they think it the happieſt thing in the World to abound in Luxury, and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Pleaſures. Some there are who uſe theſe Cauſes and Ends interchangeably; as they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56937:65"/>
who deſire Riches as a Means to obtain Power and Pleaſures; or as they who deſire Power, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that by it they may get Money or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a Name: About theſe and ſuch like things the Intention of all humane Actions and Deſires is verſed and employed, as Nobility and popular Applauſe are ſought after by ſome, which Men think do make them famous, and Wives and Children by others are deſired for the ſake of Pleaſure. Only Friendſhip, which is a ſacred kind of Tie, is not to be reckoned amongſt the Goods of Fortune, but amongſt thoſe of Vertue: but all other things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired either for the Power or the Pleaſure which they afford. Now for the Goods of the Body, they are to be referred to the things mentioned before: For Strength, and the large Proportion of Parts, ſeem to give Power and Worthineſs, Beauty and Swiftneſs, to afford Glory and Fame; and Health and Indolence of Body yield Joy and Pleaſure. In all theſe things it appears that Happineſs is only wanting; for whatever any one deſireth above other things, he judgeth that to be the chief Good: But we have already defined Happineſs to be the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of Goods; wherefore every one judgeth that to be the happieſt State, which he deſires above all others. Thou haſt now therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine Eyes an exact Scheme and Form of humane Felicity, that is, Riches, Honours,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56937:65"/>
Powers, Glory and Pleaſure, which laſt was only conſidered by<note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Epicurus.] Epicurus</hi> was a Philoſopher known enough: In <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> he taught that Bodies were compounded of <hi>Atoms;</hi> and in <hi>Ethicks,</hi> that the chief or ſovereign Good did conſiſt in Pleaſure: and argued thus; Since there are no other Goods except <hi>Riches, Honours, Power, Glory and Pleaſures;</hi> that Good amongſt theſe which excels the others ought to be eſteemed the <hi>Sovereign Good;</hi> but Pleaſure ſeems to excel all the others, becauſe the reſt are not ſought after, but becauſe they ſeem to bring Joyfulneſs and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the Mind. Voluptuous Men are from him uſually called <hi>Epicures.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Epicurus;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he did declare that Happineſs conſiſted in that alone, becauſe he imagined that other things did withdraw Joy and Chearfulneſs from the Heart and Spirits. But I return to the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Inclinations of Men, whoſe Minds are always bent upon the chief Good, and are ever ſeeking after it, though it ſeemeth to be as with a darkned Underſtanding, and like a drunken Man reeling about, and not knowing which Path to take which may lead him home. Do they, let me ask thee, ſeem to wander who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put themſelves into a Condition of wanting nothing? Certainly there is no State doth ſo much afford Happineſs as that of having Plenty and Affluence of all good things, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of need of being beholden to another, but having ſufficient for one's ſelf. Or are they guilty of Folly who think that what is the beſt doth deſerve Eſteem and Reverence? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56937:66"/>
no; for that thing is ſurely not vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, which all Men with ſo much Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion labour after. Is not Power to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt Goods? why not? for is that to be eſteemed feeble and without Strength, which is apparently better than all other things? Is Renown not to be regarded? but it cannot be denied, but that whatever is moſt excellent ſeemeth alſo to be moſt renowned. For to what purpoſe ſhall we ſay that Happineſs is not an anxious and melancholy thing, nor ſubject to Grief and Trouble, ſince even in the leaſt things Men ſeek for what may delight and pleaſe them? Theſe are the things which Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to obtain and poſſeſs, and for this Cauſe do they labour after Riches, Dignities, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Glory, and Pleaſure, that they may have Sufficiences and Abundance within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that ſo they may arrive at Eſteem, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Fame. It muſt therefore be a Good, of which all are in queſt by ſo divers Ways and different Studies: And from hence it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appear how great the Power and Force of Nature is, ſince notwithſtanding that all Men differ very much in their Opinions of Good, yet they All agree in the choice of the End of it.</p>

               <p>AND you, O Men, whoſe Thoughts are ſo employed upon things below, that I may fitly call you earthly Animals, do think ever of your Beginning, though it be but with a dreaming and darkned Imagination, and you have always the true end of Happineſs in view, although you have no clear and perfect Notion of it: So that though your natural Intention leads you to the true Good, yet indirect and manifold Error draws you from it. Conſider now if Men can by thoſe Means by which they endeavour to attain Happineſs, arrive at their deſired End. For if Riches, if Honours, and other the like Acceſſions can place one in ſuch a State, that he ſhall ſeem to want no other thing to make him happy, then will I confeſs that Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity may be derived from ſuch Acquiſitions. But if ſo it be that theſe cannot make good what they ſeem ſo fairly to promiſe, and that thoſe who poſſeſs them in the greateſt meaſure, do yet want many other Advantages and good things, will not the counterfeit and miſtaken Face of Happineſs be clearly diſcovered in them? Firſt of all therefore I ask thee, who not long ſince didſt abound in Riches, whether ſometimes in that great abundance thy Mind
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56937:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was not anxious and diſcompoſed upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of any notable Injury?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boet.</speaker>
                  <p>No.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Then hence it follows that Riches cannot put a Man beyond all want, nor make him ſelf-ſufficient, although this was it which they ſeem'd to promiſe. And this alſo I think of great Moment to be conſidered, that Money hath nothing in its own Nature which can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its being taken from the Poſſeſſor, though againſt his Will.</p>

                  <p>It is plain.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Then every Man needeth foreign Helps to maintain the Poſſeſſion of his Money.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boet.</speaker>
                  <p>Who denies it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But he would not want ſuch Help unleſs he were the Owner of Money, which he is in a poſſibility of loſing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boet.</speaker>
                  <p>That is unqueſtionable.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Then is the thing turned into its contrary; for Riches, which were thought to have made a Man ſelf-ſufficient, do rather make him have need of Aid from others. By what way do Riches drive away Neceſſity? Can rich Men be neither hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry nor thirſty? Are not the Bodies of the Rich ſenſible of Winter's Cold? But perhaps thou mayſt ſay, ſuch Men have wherewith to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy this, and to quench that, and to keep out the other. By theſe Means it's true that Riches may comfort and ſupport thoſe who ſuffer theſe things, but they cannot wholly free them from ſuch Inconveniences. But if theſe Neceſſities, which are ever gaping and asking for more, cannot be ſupplied with Wealth, then there ſtill remains ſomething which ſhould be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſhall not now urge that the ſmalleſt things are ſufficient for Nature, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is enough for Avarice. But if Riches cannot remove Want, but rather create it, why ſhould Men vainly imagine that they can meet and ſupply all humane Neceſſities?</p>

                  <p>I now ſee plainly that Men cannot arrive at a full Satisfaction by Riches, nor at Power by enjoying Principalities or Kingdoms, nor at Eſteem and Reverence by the Acceſſion of Dignities, nor at Nobility by Glory, nor at true Joy by carnal Pleaſures.</p>

                  <p>The Reaſon is moſt obvious, for humane Error doth ſeparate and divide that which is ſimple, and by Nature indiviſible, and doth tranſport it from that which is true and perfect to their contrary. Let me ask thee, can that, doſt thou think, which needeth nothing want Power?</p>

                  <p>Thou thinkeſt right indeed; for if there be any thing which, upon any occaſion of Performance, doth ſhew a Weakneſs or want of Power, it muſt, as to that, neceſſarily need foreign Aid.</p>

                  <p>What doſt thou think then? Is that an obſcure and ignoble thing which is grac'd with theſe three great Attributes of Self-ſufficiency, Power and Reverence, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways is it noble and worthy of Fame? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, as we have granted before, that he who wants Gifts of Fortune; who is moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and moſt worthy of Renown, if he, I ſay, want Fame, which he cannot give to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he may on that hand, in ſome meaſure, ſeem more weak and abject.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Bo.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deny it, but aver as it is, that Renown at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the aforeſaid things.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence Renown differs nothing from the three above-mention'd Attributes.</p>

in a State of Joy, if what I have ſaid be true. And then may we alſo grant Self-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, Power, Nobility, Reverence and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, do differ only in Name, but not in Eſſence or Subſtance.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Then therefore that which is one ſimple Nature is torn violently aſunder by the Pravity of Men; and whilſt they endeavour for a part of a thing which wants Parts, they neither get that Part, nor the entire thing which they ſo much deſire.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Why thus; He who in amaſſing Riches propoſeth only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the end of avoiding Poverty, is no way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to obtain Power; he had rather be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and obſcure, and chuſeth rather to withdraw from himſelf many natural Pleaſures, than run the hazard of loſing that Money which he hath gathered. But ſurely ſuch an one by this means doth not purchaſe Self-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, when he loſeth Power, when he is prick'd with Trouble, when his ſordid Ways make him be looked upon as an Out-caſt, when he is hidden in Obſcurity. If we come to the Perſon who only aims at Power, he ſquanders away Riches, he deſpiſeth Pleaſures, he ſlights Honour which is not accompanied with Power, and contemns Glory. So then thou ſeeſt how many things that Man wanteth. For often he muſt ſtand in need of Neceſſaries, he muſt be ſubject to great Anxieties; and when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56937:80"/>
drive away theſe things, he ſhews clearly his want of that which he did moſt affect, I mean Power. One may alſo reaſon thus of Honours, of Glory, and of Pleaſures. For whilſt every one of theſe is the ſame with the reſt, whoever endeavours to obtain any of theſe without the other, loſeth that which he deſireth.</p>

               <p>NOW that thou haſt had the Character of the true, and alſo of the falſe Felicity truly repreſented to thee, I think it time to ſhew thee in what the Perfection of Happineſs is placed. And whilſt we are in queſt of this, I think our beſt Method will be to examine, whether there can in Nature be ſuch a Good as that which thou haſt before defin'd, leſt the Vanity of Imagination, and Heat of Thought, ſhould deceive us, and carry us beyond the Truth of the Matter ſubjected to our Inquiry. But that ſuch a thing doth exiſt, and that it is as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56937:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it were the Fountain of all Good, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; for every thing which is ſaid to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect is proved to be ſo by the Diminution of that which is perfect. Hence it is that if any thing in any kind be ſaid to be imperfect, it is preſently underſtood that in it there is alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfect. For if Perfection be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, no Man can tell in what that which is ſaid to be imperfect can exiſt. For Nature doth not derive her Origine from things diminiſhed and inconſummate, but proceeding from an intire and abſolute Subſtance, ſhe extends her ſelf in the remoteſt and moſt fruitleſs Beings. So that if, as before I have demonſtrated, there be a certain imperfect Felicity, a fading Good, there muſt alſo be, without doubt, a ſolid and perfect one. It is moſt logically and truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded (ſaid I). But where this doth reſide (continued ſhe) thus conſider; That God the Governour of all things is good, is proved by the univerſal Opinion of all Men. For ſince nothing can be found out which is better than God, who will deny Him to be good, than whom nothing can be better? Reaſon then doth ſo clearly demonſtrate that God is good, that at the ſame time it evinceth the ſovereign Good to be in him. For if it were not ſo, he could not be the Ruler of all things; for there would be ſome Being excelling him, which would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the perfect Good, and in this World ſeem
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56937:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to excel him, and be antienter than he. We have already ſhewn that all perfect things excel thoſe which are leſs perfect. Wherefore that we may not infinitely produce our Reaſons, it muſt be confeſs'd that the great God is full of the greateſt and moſt perfect Goodneſs. But we have already ſhewn that perfect Goodneſs is true Happineſs. Therefore it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that true and conſummate Happineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides only in the great and moſt perfect God. This (returned I) I apprehend aright, nor can I by any means ſay againſt it. Then I pray thee (ſaith ſhe) ſee how well and irrefragably thou canſt prove what I have ſaid, to wit, that God is wholly repleniſhed with the ſovereign Good. How ſhall I do that? (replied I). Doſt thou preſume (ſaid ſhe) that the Father of all things hath received this ſovereign Good, with which he is proved to abound, from any thing without himſelf, or that he hath it ſo naturally that thou ſhouldſt imagine that He poſſeſſing it, and Happineſs poſſeſſed, are of different Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? If thou doſt think that he received it from any foreign Hand, thou muſt imagine the Giver to be more excellent than the Receiver. But that God is the moſt excellent of all Beings, moſt worthily we confeſs, if we own then that the ſovereign Good is in him by Nature; and yet we may conceive that it is not the ſame that he is, ſince we ſpeak of God, who is the Prince
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56937:85"/>
of Nature, let him who can find out who it was that joined theſe ſo differing things. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatever doth eſſentially differ from any thing, it cannot be ſaid to be that from which it is underſtood to differ. Therefore that which is in its Nature differing from the chief Good, cannot be ſaid to be the Good it ſelf: which to think of God would be moſt impious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, ſince nothing can excel him in Goodneſs and Worth. Nothing that ever was can in its Nature be better than that from which it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its Beginnings. Wherefore that which is the Principle of all things muſt, as to its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, with the trueſt reaſon be concluded to be the chief of Goods.</p>

                  <p>Look then a little further, and ſee if this Truth can be proved more firmly thus, to wit, that there cannot be two ſovereign Goods which differ in themſelves: For it is clear, that of the Goods which differ, one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be what the other is; wherefore neither can be perfect when one wants the other. But it is evident, that that which is not perfect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſovereign; therefore thoſe which are the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56937:85"/>

But as from Mens being endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Vertue of Juſtice, they are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Juſt; and from that of Prudence they are pronounced Wiſe, ſo ſhould they who are poſſeſſed of Divinity by parity of reaſon be eſteemed Gods.

Since Happineſs ſeems to comprehend in it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, to conſider whether they all, by the Variety of Parts conjoined, do conſtitute the Body of Happineſs; or whether there may be any one amongſt them which may compleat the Subſtance of it, and to which all the reſt may be referr'd.</p>

If all theſe things were Members of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, they would differ amongſt themſelves; for it is of the Nature of differing Parts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one Body: But it is already demonſtrated that all things are the ſame, therefore they are not Parts; for if ſo, even out of one of them Happineſs might be compoſed, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</p>

                  <p>It is clear that all other things are brought to be tried by Good as the Rule and Square: For Self-ſufficiency is therefore deſired, becauſe it is thought to be Good: So alſo it may be ſaid of Power, Eſteem, Nobility, Pleaſure. Good then is the Cauſe why all things are deſired; for that which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Reality nor Shew doth retain any thing of Good, is by no means to be deſired: On the contrary, whatever by Nature is not good, if yet it ſeems to be ſo, is deſired as if it really were ſo. Hence it is that Goodneſs, juſtly looked upon, is the Cauſe, the Sum, the Hinge from which all our Deſires ariſe, in which they centre, and upon which they turn. That which is the Cauſe of our deſiring any thing, ſeems it ſelf moſt to be deſired. For if any Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to ride abroad becauſe of his Health, he doth not ſo much deſire the Motion of Riding as the Effect of his Health. Since therefore all things are ſought after for the ſake of Good, they cannot be more deſirable than Good it ſelf. But we have before ſhewed that it is Happineſs for which all theſe aboveſaid things are deſired, where it is clear that only Happineſs is ſought for. He then who conſiders this cannot deny that Good and Happineſs are of one and the ſame Subſtance.</p>

                  <p>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou then that every Being doth ſo long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and ſubſiſt as it is entire and knit together by Unity; but that as ſoon as it looſes that Bond it is diſſolv'd, and Privation follows?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>How

                  <p>Thus; As in Animals or ſenſitive Creatures it is plain, the Soul and Body being united and continuing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Being then is called Animal, a living Creature: but ſo ſoon as this Unity is diſſolved by the Separation of theſe, it immediately pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, ceaſing to be what it was before. The Body alſo it ſelf, which whilſt it remains in one Form by the Conjunction of its Members, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Form and Reſemblance of a Man; but if by diſſevering and ſegregating the Parts that Oneneſs is diſtracted, it is no more what before it was. In the ſame manner, if we run through all other Beings, it will ſurely appear, that every thing, as long as it preſerveth Unity doth ſubſiſt; and if that dies, the other muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo die with it.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Is there then any thing, which inaſmuch as it lives natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, doth forgo its Deſire of Subſiſting, and affect Corruption and Annihilation?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bo.</speaker>
                  <p>If I conſider thoſe living Creatures which have any Power of willing or refuſing, I do not in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture find any thing, which without ſome fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Impulſe, or the Concurrence of outward Accidents, doth caſt away its Intention and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſubſiſting, and willingly haſten to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; for every Animal is endowed with that great Principle of Self-preſervation, and purſues it, and doth eſchew Miſchief and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56937:89"/>
Death. But if I, caſting an Eye upon the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative World, conſider Herbs and Trees, and other inanimate things, I confeſs I am under a doubt, and know not well what to think of them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But even of theſe there is no Cauſe that thou ſhouldſt doubt; for behold Herbs and Trees firſt chooſe a convenient Place to grow in, where their Nature, as much as it can, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from withering and periſhing ſoon; for ſome ſpring in the Fields, others upon Mountains, others riſe in Lakes and Marſhes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers put forth amongſt the Stones; ſome chooſe the moſt barren Sands for the Place of their Birth; and all theſe, if any Hand ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to tranſplant them to any other place, would forthwith wither. But Nature gives to every thing that which is agreeable to, and convenient for them, and endeavours that they ſhould not periſh before their time. Doſt thou not know that all Herbs and Trees, as if their Mouths were faſtned downward in the Earth, do draw up their Nouriſhment by the Root, and diffuſe their Strength and Bark as through their Marrow? And alſo that the ſofteſt and moſt tender Matter, as the Pith or Marrow is, is always laid up in the moſt inward Cabinet, and covered by a ſtrong Coat of Wood; and the uppermoſt Garment of Bark is oppoſed to the Storms and Weather, as being fitted beſt to endure them? And canſt thou not here behold
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56937:89"/>
and admire the Diligence and Care of Nature, which propagates all things by a Multiplicity of Seeds, which all Men know are as a Foundation for a Building not to remain for a time, but as if it were for ever? And even thoſe things which are thought to be inanimate, do not they by the ſame Reaſon deſire that which properly belongs to them, and to preſerve their Beings? For why ſhould Levity carry the Flames up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and Gravity make the Earth tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards its Centre, but that theſe Places and Motions agree with their ſeveral Bodies? Furthermore, whatſoever is agreeable to the Nature of any thing, that preſerves that thing, as that which hath an Abhorrency from it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts and deſtroys it. Now that which is hard, as a Stone, doth moſt tenaciouſly adhere together in all its Parts, and reſiſts an eaſy Diſſolution; but what things are liquid or flowing, as Air and Water, yield eaſily to thoſe who would ſeparate them, but ſoon again return and ſlide back to thoſe things from which they were divided: but Fire doth utterly refuſe any ſuch Diviſion. And now I do not treat of the voluntary Motions of a knowing and diſcerning Soul, but of natural Intention and Inſtinct. Thus we ſwallow our Meat without thinking of it, and draw our Breath in our Sleep without perceiving it: For the Love of Life is not derived to living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the Inclinations and Bent of their
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56937:90"/>
Souls, but only from the Principles of Nature; for the Will, often puſhed on by urgent Cauſes, affects and imbraces that Death which Nature fears and abhors: And on the contrary, we ſee that the Works of Generation, by which alone the Race of Men is propagated, and which Nature always affects, often reſtrained by the Will. Therefore this Love which every thing beareth to it ſelf, doth not proceed from the Motions of the Soul, but from the Intentions of Nature: For Providence hath given to all things created by it, this greateſt Cauſe and Principle of Duration, to wit, a Deſire of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting as long as it can. Therefore doubt not but every Being hath a natural Appetite towards Living, and an Abhorrence of Diſſolution.</p>

I give this excellent Being, whatever it is, by which all things created endure, and are actuated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the known Denomination of God.</p>

and ſafe, and that thou mayſt reviſit thy own Countrey: But let us reflect a little upon what we have before propoſed. Have not we agreed that Sufficiency is of the Nature of true Happineſs? And have we not granted that God is that true Happineſs?</p>

               <p>Philoſophy teacheth <hi>Boetius,</hi> who wondered why evil things happen to the good, and good things to evil Men, that the good are powerful, and the other impotent; that Rewards are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for thoſe, and Puniſhments for them; that impious Men are more miſerable, if they do Injuries and remain unpuniſhed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe defines what Providence is, and what Fate. Then ſhe demonſtrates, that all Fortune, whether proſperous or adverſe, is good.</p>

               <p>WHen Philoſophy, preſerving the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and the Gravity of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, had in ſoft and ſweet Strains ſung theſe things, I not having wholly forgot my Grief, and the Diſtemper of my Mind remaining, did thus interrupt her, being now ready to have continued her Diſcourſe. Thoſe things, O thou Fore-runner and Giver of the true Light! which thou haſt hitherto deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, are evidently clear and unanſwerable, as well from that Divine Teſtimony which they bear about them, as from thy irrefragable Reaſons: and although I had forgotten them, through the Prevalency of Grief for the many Injuries which I have endured, yet, as thou haſt ſaid, I was not wholly ignorant of them: But this one thing, I muſt own, is the greateſt Cauſe of my Sorrow, to wit, that whilſt there is one good Ruler of all things, there ſhould be any Evil at all, or at the leaſt, that it ſhould paſs unpuniſhed. And how worthy this is of Admiration thou mayſt conſider. To this alſo another greater Miſchief is adjoined: For whilſt Impiety doth bear Command and flouriſh, Vertue doth not only want its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but is alſo trampled upon by wicked
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56937:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Men, and bears the Puniſhment due to its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. No Man therefore can enough wonder and complain that Affairs ſhould move ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Governance of a God all-knowing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and willing nothing but what is the beſt. And it would indeed, returned ſhe, be a thing not only of infinite Wonder, but alſo horribly monſtrous, if in the well-regulated Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of ſo great a Maſter, the worthleſs Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, as thou imagineſt, ſhould be honoured, and the more pretious ones be deſpiſed: But thou art miſtaken, it is not truly ſo: For if theſe Concluſions which I have drawn be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſerved entire, thou ſhalt well know by the Authority of God, of whoſe Reign and Government I now ſpeak, that the Good are always powerful and mighty, the evil Men ever Caſt-aways and weak; that Vice never paſſeth without its Puniſhment, nor Vertue without its Rewards; that Happineſs always attends good Men, and Misfortunes the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe and many other things of this kind ſhall be proved to thee, which may put an end to thy Complaints, and ſtrengthen thee with all Firmneſs and Solidity. And becauſe I have lately ſhewn to thee, with a full Face, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of true Happineſs, and alſo in what it is placed, and all things being run through which I think neceſſary to be premiſed, I ſhall now chalk out to thee that direct way which will
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56937:97"/>
lead thee again to thy own Habitation. I will alſo affix Wings to thy Mind, by which it may raiſe it ſelf on high, that ſo all Trouble being done away, and all Obſtacles remov'd, thou mayſt by my Direction, by my Way, by my Conveniences of travelling, return ſafe into thy own Country.</p>

                  <p>O Wonderfull thou promiſeſt great things indeed! nor do I doubt but thou canſt perform them: therefore I intreat thee, without delay, to ſatisfy my Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>Firſt then thou ſhalt know that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Men are always armed with Power, and that the wicked are always deſtitute of Strength; and theſe Aſſertions do mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate each other: For ſince Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil are contrary, if Good be powerful, Evil muſt be weak and frail; and if thou knoweſt the Frailneſs of Evil, the Firmneſs of Good muſt alſo be known to thee. But that the Credit and Truth of my Opinion may appear more abundantly, I will proceed in both ways, confirming what is propoſed now on this, now on that part. There are two Poles upon which all humane Actions do turn, that is to ſay, the Will and Power; if either of theſe be abſent, nothing can be done: For the Will being want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56937:99"/>
no Man attempts to do that which he will not do; and if Power faileth, the Will is of no Effect. Hence it is, that if thou ſeeſt any Man deſirous to obtain that which he doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, thou needſt not doubt but he wanted the Power of obtaining that which he would have.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Whom then thou ſeeſt do that which he had a mind to do, canſt thou doubt that he had a Power to do it?</p>

                  <p>Canſt thou call to mind that it hath been ſhewed, that Happineſs is the Sovereign Good, and that when Happineſs is ſought for, Good is deſired of all?</p>

                  <speaker>Bo.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>All Men then, the good as well as the bad, with one and the ſame Intention, endeavour to arrive at Good.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Since therefore then both Parties are in queſt of Good, but theſe only obtain it and the other loſe it, it is not at all to be doubted but that good Men are powerful, and the wicked weak and feeble.</p>

                  <p>Thou wilt not deny but the Motion of Walking is natural to Men?</p>

                  <p>And thou doubteſt not, but to perform this Motion is the natural Office of the Feet?</p>

                  <p>If then he who is able to uſe his Feet walks, and if another to whom this natural Office of the Feet is wanting, creeping upon his Hands, doth endeavour to walk, which of theſe, by right, ought to be eſteemed more able?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bo.</speaker>
                  <p>Proceed with what remains; for no

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But the Sovereign Good, which even the Vertuous and Impious propoſe to themſelves as their End, by the one Party is ſought by the natural means of Vertue, whilſt the other endeavours after it by various and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Deſires of earthly things, which is not the natural way of obtaining it; doſt thou think otherwiſe?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bo.</speaker>
                  <p>No; for the Conſequence is plain, and it appears out of that which before I granted, which was, that the Good were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with Power and Might, and that the evil Men were deſtitute of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Thou doſt rightly run before me; and it is a good Sign, as Phyſicians obſerve, when Nature exerts her ſelf, and reſiſts the Malady. But becauſe I perceive thou art quick of Apprehenſion, and ready to underſtand, I ſhall continue to thee my Reaſons: Behold then how plainly the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity and Weakneſs of vitious Men lies open, who cannot even attain to that to which their natural Intention leads them, and which it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt compels them to ſeek. And what doſt thou think would become of theſe Men, if they were deſerted by this almoſt unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bent and Help of Nature, which always goes before them? Conſider with thy ſelf how great the Impotence of wicked Men is: Nor are they ſlight and empty things to which they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56937:100"/>
aſpire, and which they have not Power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: But they attempt the chief and higheſt of all things, and there they fail; nor can bring that to effect after which they by Day and Night endeavour; and in the obtaining of which the Might of the Vertuous is eminent. For as thou mayſt deem him a good Walker, who hath been able to go ſo far on his Feet, that no way doth lie beyond the Place at which he is arrived; ſo muſt thou neceſſarily judg him to be moſt mighty, who hath attained that thing beyond which nothing is to be deſired. True then it is, that wicked Men are wholly deſtitute of thoſe Powers which the Good am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply poſſeſs: For why do they leave Vertue and purſue Vice? Is it becauſe they know not Good? But what is more weak and baſe than the Blindneſs of Ignorance? or are they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps acquainted with the way which they ought to follow? But Luſt, or ſome inordinate Deſires do lead them aſide; ſo doth alſo Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance to weak Natures, which cannot reſiſt Vice. But do they knowingly and willingly deſert Good, and turn to Evil? But this way they do not only ceaſe to be mighty, but alſo even to be. For thoſe who neglect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon End of all Beings, do alſo leave off to be. Which thing perhaps to ſome may ſeem won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that the Vitious, who make up the moſt numerous Part of Mankind, ſhould not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56937:101"/>
be Men; but it is moſt truly ſo. And thus it is. I do not deny but that the Wicked are wicked; but that they have any Being, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſimply, I deny: For as thou mayſt call a Carcaſe a dead Man, but ſimply thou canſt not call it a Man; ſo will I grant that the Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are vitious Men, but abſolutely that they exiſt I cannot confeſs. That thing is or hath a Being which obſerveth its Order, and retains its Nature; but that which faileth in this, deſerteth its natural Being. But thou mayſt ſay, that even the Wicked have a Power to act: Nor will I deny it; but this their Power is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Strength but Weakneſs. They can do Evil, 'tis true, but they could not do that if they perſevered in doing Good; which Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility doth clearly demonſtrate that they can do nothing: For if, as we have before gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Evil be nothing, it is clear that whilſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious Men can only do ill, they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And that thou mayſt underſtand what is the Bent and Force of this Power, we have before determined that nothing is more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the Sovereign Good.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Then ſince he who can only do Good, can
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56937:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do all things, and thoſe who are powerful to do Evil cannot do all things, it is moſt evident that thoſe who do Evil are leſs powerful. And yet it further aſſiſts me towards the proving of what I have ſhewed, that all Power is to be reckoned amongſt things to be deſired; and that all things are to be referr'd to the chief Good, as the Height and Eminency of their Nature: But the Power of committing Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs cannot be referred to that Good; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not deſirable: but all Power is deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is therefore clear that the Power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil is not Power. Upon the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from hence the Power of good Men, and the undoubted Weakneſs of evil Men may well appear. Hence alſo is the Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> verified, That only wiſe Men can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that which they deſire, whilſt the Wicked, let them endeavour what they will, can never accompliſh what they deſire to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that is, to aim at Happineſs; for they do what they liſt, whilſt by thoſe Actions in which they delight, they think they ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Good which they deſire; but they can never be Poſſeſſors of it, for Impiety can never be crown'd with Happineſs.</p>

                  <p>DOST thou ſee then in what a Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Filth Impiety doth wallow, and with what Rays of Light Goodneſs doth ſhine out? By which it is clear, that good Men
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56937:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
never go without a Reward, and evil Men without Puniſhment; for that which cauſes any thing to be undertaken and done, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid to be the Reward of that thing which is done; as the Crown which is won is the Reward of him who runs in the Race for it. But we have already ſhewn that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is that Good for which all Matters are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. Therefore Happineſs is the Reward propos'd to all humane Actions; and of this the Vertuous can by no means be deprived, nor can any Man by right be called Good who wanteth Goodneſs; therefore Vertue can never want its Reward. But however evil Men may be unquiet or rage, yet the Crown ſhall never fall from the Head of the wiſe Man, nor wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon it. Nor can the Impiety of another Man bereave a worthy Soul of its Honour: But if a Man be carried away by the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any foreign Good, he may be deprived even of this, either by him who gave it to him, or by any other. But becauſe every Man's proper Good procureth to him his Reward, whoſoever ceaſeth to be good loſeth that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Laſtly, ſince a Reward is deſired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſuppoſed to be a Good, who will judg him who is capable of Good to be uncapable of a Reward? But thou wilt ſay, of what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is he worthy? Of the faireſt, certainly, and moſt conſiderable. Call to mind that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56937:103"/>
Corollary, which a little before ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, I gave to thee, and conſider thus: Since the Sovereign Good is Happineſs, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that all good Men, in that they are good, become happy; and thoſe who are good, are as it were Gods. Therefore is the Reward of vertuous Men ſuch, that no time ſhall impair it, no Power diminiſh it, nor any Impiety darken it. Since theſe things then are thus, a wiſe Man cannot at all doubt of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which inſeparably attends wicked Men: For ſince Good and Evil are Contraries, ſo are Rewards and Puniſhments: therefore as we ſee that Rewards follow good Actions, there muſt neceſſarily alſo, on the other hand, be the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for Evil. Then as Vertue it ſelf is a Reward to vertuous Men, ſo Vice is a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Wicked: whoever then is puniſhed with Pain and Uneaſineſs, it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is affected with Evil. If therefore they will rightly weigh themſelves, can they ſeem to be free from Puniſhments, whom Wickedneſs, the moſt extreme Evil, doth not only affect, but even vehemently infect? But now behold, on the other hand, what Puniſhment attends evil Doers; for thou haſt learnt a little before, that every Being is one, and that that one is Good. Hence it follows, that every thing which is, or hath a Being, ſeems to be good: Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever then fails to be good, fails to be: So that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56937:103"/>
it appears that evil Men ceaſe to be what they were; but the remaining Form of the Body ſhews that theſe evil Men were before how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men; wherefore when they loſe their Vertue, they alſo loſe their humane Nature. But ſince only Vertue can carry Men above the common Pitch of Humanity, it is ſure that thoſe whom Vice hath depoſed from the common Condition of Mankind, it muſt alſo throw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Merit of Men. Then it happens that you cannot eſteem him to be a Man, whom you ſee thus transform'd by his Vices. Doth the violent Oppreſſor, and the Raviſher of other Mens Goods, burn with Avarice? Thou mayſt ſay that he reſembles the Wolf. Is he fierce; and doth he give himſelf over to Controverſies and Chiding? Thou mayſt compare him to the Dog. Is he treacherous, and one who delights to deceive? He is then like the young Foxes. Is he intemperate in his Anger? He ſeems to carry about with him the Fury of the Lion. Is he timorous and fearful of what ought not to be fear'd? He is like the Hart. Is he light, and doth he inconſtantly change his Purpoſes? He differs nothing from the Birds of the Air. Doth he wallow in filthy and unclean Luſts? He rolls himſelf in the Mire like the naſty Sow. So that whoſoever leaves off to be vertuous, ceaſes to be a Man; and ſince he cannot attain to a Divine Nature, he is turn'd into a Beaſt.</p>

                  <p>From this then, and from ſeveral other Reaſons founded on the ſame bottom, it appears, that Impiety, properly and by its own Nature, makes Men miſerable; and that an Injury done to any Man is the Miſery of the Doer, and not of the Sufferer. But now Orators and Advocates run a Courſe contrary to this: For they endeavour the Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of the Judges for thoſe who ſuffered any thing bitter or grievous, when the juſter Pity is due to them who did the Wrong; who ſhould be led to Judgment, as the Sick are to the Phyſician, not by angry but by merciful and compaſſionate Accuſers; that ſo they may, by the Application of Puniſhment, as a fit and proper Remedy, be cured of the Malady of the Crime. By this means the Employment of this kind of Defenders would either wholly ceaſe, or elſe, that it may be more to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Mankind, it would be turned into an Habit of Accuſation, and would always be forward to accuſe, and not to excuſe ill Men: and even thoſe Wretches themſelves, if they could through the leaſt Hole or Chink behold that Vertue which they have forſaken, and ſee that they ſhould be in ſome way of cleanſing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56937:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
themſelves from their filthy Vices, by receiving the Pains and Torments which are due to them, they ought, for the Recompence of regaining the Vertue from which they have fallen, not to eſteem them ſo, but ſhould chearfully refuſe the Defence of their Advocates, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up wholly to their Accuſers and Judges. Hence it is that the Wiſe hate no Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For who but the moſt fooliſh would hate good Men? and it is irrational to hate the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate: For if a depraved Temper be, as it were, the Sickneſs of the Soul, ſince we do not think thoſe whoſe Bodies are diſtempered to be worthy of our Hate, but rather of our Compaſſion, much leſs are thoſe over whom Vice, more cruel than any bodily Diſtemper, hath gain'd the Aſcendant to be adjudged ſo, but are rather to be looked upon as Subjects of our Pity.</p>

                  <p>HERE I plainly ſee what Happineſs or Miſery is placed in the Deſerts of good and of evil Men.

For in this the more clearly and openly the Duty of Wiſdom doth appear, when the Happineſs of the Governours is in ſome meaſure diffuſed, and communicated to Subjects; whilſt Impriſonment, and all legal Puniſhments are only due to thoſe pernicious
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56937:110"/>
and profligate Citizens, for whom they were at firſt inſtituted and appointed. Why then ſhould things ſuffer ſo unnatural a Change? Why ſhould Puniſhments due to Crimes, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Good, and the Rewards of Vertue be born only by wicked and flagitious Men? Theſe things I much wonder at, and I deſire to learn from thee what may be the Reaſon of ſo unjuſt a Diſtribution. For my Wonder would be leſs, did I believe all things to be governed by Chance. But now even God, the Governour of all things, doth heighten my Aſtoniſhment, who whilſt he doth often diſtribute good things to the Good, and evil things to the Wicked, yet doth ſometimes give to the Vertuous an hard Portion, and to the impious Man he grants his Heart's Deſire.

                  <p>The Generation of all things, and every Progreſſion of changeable Natures, and all things which are any way moved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Cauſes, Order and Forms out of the Stability or Conſtancy of the Divine Mind. And this being placed in the Height of its own Purity or Simplicity, doth eſtabliſh a manifold Mode or Way in doing things; which Mode or Manner of Proceeding, when Men behold it in the Purity of the Divine Underſtanding, is called Providence; but being apply'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to that which it moveth, and of which it diſpoſeth, it was called Fate or Deſtiny. And if any one ſhall throughly weigh in his Mind the Force and Energy of the one and of the other, he ſhall ſoon find them to be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things: For Providence is that Divine Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſettled in the chief Governour of the World, by which he diſpoſeth all things; but Fate or
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56937:113"/>
Deſtiny is a Diſpoſition inherent in moveable Beings, by which Providence knits them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Orders. Providence embraces and comprehends all things, although divers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though infinite; but Fate orders and digeſts all ſingle things into Motion, and diſtributeth them according to Place, Form and Time: So that the Explication of this temporal Order being joined or folded up, in regard to the Divine Mind, may be called Providence; and being unfolded and digeſted according to Time, and the other Circumſtances, it may be called Fate. And although theſe things be different, yet one of them depends upon the other; for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Fate proceeds from the pure Simplicity of Providence: For as the Artificer forming in his Mind the Shape of the thing which he is about to make, moves to effect his Work, and doth in proceſs of time draw out that which before he had ſingly in his Imagination deſigned; ſo God by his Providence ſimply and firmly doth diſpoſe the things which are to be done; and he doth in ſeveral Ways, and according to Time, adminiſter by Fate thoſe very things which he hath ſo diſpoſed. So then, whether Fate be exerciſed and moved by ſome Divine Spirits which attend upon Providence, or by ſome Soul, or by the Miniſtry of the whole Body of Nature, or by the Celeſtial Motions of the Stars, or by Angelick Vertue, or by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56937:113"/>
Subtlety of Demons, whether good or bad, or if by any of theſe, or if by all of them the Series of Fate is woven: This certainly is manifeſt, that the immovable and ſimple way of doing things is Providence; and that the movable Contexture and temporal Order of thoſe things which the Divine Purity fore-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ordered to be done, is Fate. Hence it is that all things which are under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Fate, are alſo ſubject to Providence, which commands even Fate it ſelf. But ſome things which are placed under the Guidance and Protection of Providence, are wholly exempt from the Juriſdiction of Fate, and ſurmount the Series of it; and thoſe are ſuch things as are ſtably fixed near to the Divinity, and are above the Order of fatal Mobility. For even as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſeveral Circles turning about the ſame Centre, that which is innermoſt approacheth moſt to the Simplicity of the middle Point, and is as it were a Centre, round which they may turn, to thoſe placed without it; and that which is outermoſt, rolling in a greater Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, the further it departs from the middle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuity of the Point, ſo much the more Space it doth fill; but yet if any thing ſhould join and faſten it ſelf to the Point, it is conſtrained to be immovable, and ceaſeth to be dilated. By pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Reaſon the further any thing departeth from the firſt Mind, that is from God, it is ſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56937:114"/>
much the more embaraſſed, and faſter bound in the Bonds of Deſtiny; and every thing is by ſo much the freer from Fate, by how much it approacheth nearer to the Centre of all things. And if it cloſely adheres to the Firmneſs of the ſupreme Mind, without moving, it goes beyond the Neceſſity and Power of Deſtiny. As Ratiocination then is to the Intellect, as that which is begotten is to that which hath a proper Being, as Time is to Eternity, as the Circle is to the Centre; ſo is the movable Order of Fate to the ſtable Simplicity of Providence. This Order moveth the Heavens and the Stars, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth the Elements, and maketh them agree amongſt themſelves, and by an alternative Change transforms them. It reneweth all things which are born, and which die by the like Progreſſions of Sexes and Seeds. This binds together the Actions and Fortunes of Men by an indiſſoluble Connection of Cauſes; which, ſince they proceed from the Origine of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Providence, muſt alſo themſelves neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be unchangeable: For ſo things are always beſt governed, if that pure Simplicity or Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs, dwelling in the Divine Nature, may produce that unalterable Order of Cauſes; for this Order, by its own Unchangeableneſs and Conſtancy, may reſtrain thoſe things which in their Nature are mutable, and which would otherwiſe raſhly and irregularly float about.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56937:114"/>
Hence it is that although things may ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and diſturbed to Men who cannot aright conſider this Order, nevertheleſs the proper Manner and Courſe of every thing directs and diſpoſeth it to the true Good: For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done for the ſake of Evil, no not by the moſt flagitious Wretches; who, as I have fully before demonſtrated, are in their Reſearches after Good diverted by crooked Error, whilſt the Order proceeding from the Centre of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Good doth not miſlead any from its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. But thou mayſt ſay, what greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion can there be, that both proſperous and adverſe things ſhould by times happen to good Men, and that evil Men can enjoy what their Hearts can deſire, and yet be afflicted too with things which they hate? Do People live now a-days ſo vertuouſly, and with ſo much Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, that thoſe whom Men think good or bad, muſt neceſſarily be either? But in this the Judgments of Men diſagree much: For thoſe whom ſome judg worthy of a Reward, others think to deſerve Puniſhment. But let us grant, that it is poſſible that ſome one may be able to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Good and the Bad; Is it poſſible therefore that he ſhould look into the inward Temperament of the Mind, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce of it as one may of the Body? But it is miraculous to him who knows it not, why ſweet things ſhould be agreeable to ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56937:115"/>
and bitter to others; and why ſome ſick People are eaſed by Lenitives, others are helped by ſharper Medicines. But it is no wonder to the Phyſician, who knoweth the Meaſure and Temperament of Health and Sickneſs. But what other thing is it that makes the Mind healthful and ſtrong than Goodneſs? And what is its Sickneſs but Vice? Who is the Preſerver of Good, and the Driver away of Evil, other than God the great Ruler and Phyſician of the Mind? who, when he looks about him from the high Obſervatory of his Providence, ſees and knows what is convenient for every one, and then accommodates him with the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. Hence then proceeds that remarkable Miracle of the Order of Deſtiny, ſince the all-knowing God doth that at which the Ignorant are aſtoniſhed. But now that I may glance at a few things concerning the Depth of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledg, which humane Reaſon may comprehend, that Man whom thou believeſt to be moſt juſt, and the greateſt Obſerver and Maintainer of Equity, of that Man, I ſay, the all-knowing Providence doth think otherwiſe.

                     <hi>Vertues do build up the Body of the Holy Man.</hi> But it often comes to paſs that good Men have the Government of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56937:116"/>
things committed to them, that the exuberant Improbity of ill Men may be repell'd and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. To ſome, according to the Qualities of their Minds, he gives a kind of Mixture of Fortune, chequered with Good and Evil: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome he lays grievous heavy Croſſes, leſt they ſhould grow luxurious by too long a Courſe of Felicity: Upon others he ſometimes lays alſo heavy Croſſes, that their Vertues may be confirmed by the Uſe and Exerciſe of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Some fear more than they ought that thing which they can bear: Others deſpiſe more than they ought that which they cannot; and thoſe, that by the Experiment they may come to the Knowledg of themſelves, he ſometimes afflicts. And many there are who have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd a great Name in the World, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a glorious Death. And ſome Men whoſe Courage hath not yielded to Torment, have given a noble Example to others, that Vertue is not to be overcome by Adverſity. And there is no doubt but that all theſe things are done juſtly and in order, and for the Good of thoſe to whom they happen. It alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the ſaid Cauſes that ſometimes Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, ſometimes Proſperity, comes to be the Lot of ill Men. And it is the Wonder of no Man, that flagitious Perſons ſhould be afflicted, becauſe they are always thought to deſerve what comes upon them; and that their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56937:116"/>
Puniſhment doth deter others from ſuch Aims, and often work a Reformation in thoſe on whom they are inflicted: But the Proſperity of ſuch yields a great Argument to the Good, and directs them what to judg of this kind of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which they ſo often ſee to fall to the ſhare of the worſt of Men. In which thing I think often there is a Diſpenſation, becauſe the Nature of ſome Men may be ſo forward and importunate, that Poverty, and the want of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, would rather urge them to do ill. But this Diſeaſe Providence doth cure by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the powerful Medicine of Money. One Man finding his Conſcience deeply ſpotted with Crimes, and comparing himſelf and his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, fears perhaps that the Happineſs which he enjoyed by the Uſe of it, ſhould be wholly done away by its Loſs; he will therefore change his Manners, and whilſt he fears to loſe his Eſtate he will leave his Impiety. Upon another Happineſs is conferr'd without Deſert, and that precipitates him into a merited Deſtruction. To ſome there is a Power of Puniſhing granted, that it may exerciſe the Vertues of the Good, and may be Cauſe of Puniſhment and Torment to the Evil. For as there is no Covenant or Agreement betwixt the Vertuous and the Wicked, ſo neither can wretched Men agree amongſt themſelves. And why ſhould they? for they diſagree amongſt themſelves by reaſon
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56937:117"/>
of their Vices, which rend and tear the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and they often do thoſe things, which when they are over, they judg they ought not to have done them. From whence Providence hath often produced a ſignal Miracle, to wit, that evil Men have oft made other ill Men good: For when ſome of theſe find that they have ſuffered an Injury from others of them, urged by the Hate of thoſe that have offended them, they have returned to the Ways of Vertue, ſtudying nothing more than to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to thoſe Perſons whom they hate. It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the great Power of God which can make Evil turn to Good, when by uſing them agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and conveniently he draws out of them the Effect of ſome Good: For a certain Order embraceth all Beings, ſo that whatſoever doth depart from the Reaſon and Laws of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is aſſigned to it, yet it paſſeth into and under the Laws of another Order; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is left in the Power of Chance or Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the Realm of Providence. <gap reason="foreign">

orders and diſpoſeth every thing towards Good; and whilſt he endeavours to retain thoſe things which he hath made in his own Likeneſs, he baniſheth all Evil by the Courſe of Deſtiny, without the Bounds of his Commonwealth.

                  <p>It followeth clearly to the things before granted, that whatſoever the Fortune of all thoſe who are either in poſſeſſion of, or
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56937:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
growing in Vertue, or otherwiſe in ſearch after her, may be, it is good; but that the Fortune of thoſe who live in Impiety and Sin muſt be the worſt of any thing.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Why ſo, for the wiſe Man ought not to be caſt down when he is brought into the Field to wage War with Fortune, no more than the valiant Man ought to be diſmayed when he hears the Trumpet ſound to Battel: For Difficulty and Hardſhip giveth the Occaſion to one that he may encreaſe and propagate his Glory; and to the other, that he may confirm and improve his Wiſdom. From hence is Vertue denominated, becauſe leaning upon its own Strength, and confiding in its proper Force, it is not to be overcome by Adverſity: Nor thou who art ſo far advanced in the Courſe of Vertue, art not to be carried away by Delights, and to wallow in Luſt; thou muſt engage valiantly and fiercely againſt every Fortune. And leſt Adverſity ſhould oppreſs thee, or Proſperity corrupt thee, poſſeſs thy ſelf of the Golden Mean, and retain it with all thy Strength: For whatſoever is below, or goeth beyond that, implies a Contempt of true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and loſeth the Reward of its Labour. It lieth in thy own Hand to chooſe what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune thou likeſt; for all Fortune which ſeemeth ſharp and grievous, unleſs it exerciſe the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Good, or chaſtiſe the Impiety of the Wicked, is a Puniſhment.</p>

and moſt worthy of thy Authority: But what thou but now ſayſt, to wit, that the Queſtion concerning Providence was intangled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, I find by Experience to be true: Therefore I now ask, if Chance be any thing at all, and if it be, what thou takeſt it to be?</p>

                  <p>I haſten to pay the Debt of my Promiſe, and to open that way to thee which may lead thee back to thy Country. But although it may be very profitable, and much to thy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to know theſe things, yet they lead us out of our deſigned way: And it is to be feared that if thou ſhouldſt be tired by purſuing theſe By-paths, that is, by diſcuſſing Queſtions fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to our Subject, thou wouldſt not be able to perform thy Journey in following the right Road.</p>

                  <p>Fear not that at all; for it will as much refreſh me as Reſt, to know thoſe things in which I am moſt delighted, ſince there is no Reaſon to doubt of the things following, when every part of thy Diſputation ſhall have been grounded upon undoubted Truth and Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                  <p>I will then comply with thee: If any Man doth define Chance to be an Event pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a raſh Motion, and without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of Cauſes, I then affirm that Chance is nothing, and I pronounce it to be an empty Word, without any ſignification of the ſubject Matter; for who can imagine, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining all things by Order, there ſhould be
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56937:123"/>
any Place left for raſh Folly and Diſorder? For it is a great Truth, that nothing can ſpring out of nothing; which none of the Antients ever oppos'd, although they underſtood it not of God, the operating Principle, the chief Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Worker of all things; but they made a kind of a Foundation of a material Subject, that is, of the Nature of all Reaſon: But if any thing doth ariſe from no Cauſes, that will ſeem to ſpring out of nothing. But if this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done, it is impoſſible that Chance ſhould be any ſuch thing as it is before defined.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>My <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his Phyſicks, gives this a brief Definition, and with a Reaſon near to Truth.</p>

                  <p>How I pray thee doth he define it?</p>

                  <p>So often as a Man doth any thing, for the ſake of any other thing, and another thing than that he intended to do, is produced by other Cauſes, that thing ſo produced is called Chance: As if a Man break up the Earth upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Tillage, and find there Gold hidden, this is believed to happen by Chance, although it be not ſo: for it hath its proper Cauſes; the unforeſeen and unexpected Concourſe of which ſeemeth to have brought forth Chance: for if the Husband-man had not plowed his Field,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56937:124"/>
and if the Hider of the Gold had not hid it in that Place, the Gold had not been found. Theſe are therefore the Cauſes of a fortuitous Gain and Advantage, which proceed from a Conflux of encountring Cauſes, and not from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Doer: For neither he who hid the Gold, nor he who tilled the Field, intended or underſtood that that Treaſure ſhould be found there: But, as I ſaid, it happened that the one did dig where the other had hid his Money; and ſo theſe Actions concurring, the mentioned Effect was produc'd. Therefore Chance may be defined to be an unthought-of Event of Cauſes flowing together in things which are done to attain ſome other end: But that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which proceeds by an unavoidable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of things, ſtreaming from the Fountain of Providence, and which ranks all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Place and Time, maketh all Cauſes aſſemble and meet together.</p>

                  <p>I Underſtand this well, and I agree that what thou ſayſt is true: But is there, I pray thee, any Freedom allowed to our Wills in this long Train of cohering Cauſes, or doth the Chain of Deſtiny alſo bind the Motions of Mens Souls?</p>

                  <p>There is a Freedom of the Will, nor was there ever any rational Nature which was not accompanied with it: For that which naturally hath the Uſe of Reaſon, hath alſo a Judgment by which it may judg of, and diſcern every thing. Of it ſelf then it knoweth what things are to be avoided, and what to be deſired: Now that thing which a Man judgeth to be deſirable he ſeeks, and he refuſeth that which he deems ought to be avoided; therefore whoever is endowed with Reaſon is alſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56937:125"/>
of a Liberty of deſiring and refuſing. But I do not hold that this Liberty is equal in all Beings; for in ſupernal and divine Subſtances, ſuch as Spirits and Angels are, there is a clear Judgment, and an incorrupt Will, and a ready and efficacious Power of doing things which are deſired: But the Souls of Men muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be more free when they continue to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves in the Contemplation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mind; and they muſt be leſs ſo when they are withdrawn from that noble Speculation, and ſlide into corporal Subſtances; and yet leſs free when they are incompaſſed by, and cloſely bound up in earthly Members. But the laſt and meaneſt Slavery is, when they give themſelves over to Vice, and ſo fall from the Poſſeſſion of their proper Reaſon: for as ſoon as they remove their Eyes from the Light of the higheſt Truth, and fix them upon low, dark and baſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they are immediately wrapt in a Cloud of Ignorance, are diſturbed with pernicious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Affections; to which when they approach and agree, they help forward and increaſe that Servitude which they bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves; and in ſome manner, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Liberty proper to them, they are Captives.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56937:126"/>
ſame time there ſhould be any ſuch thing as Free-will: For if God foreſees all things, and can in no manner be deceived, then that which Providence hath foreſeen muſt neceſſarily come to paſs. Wherefore if from Eternity God doth not only fore-know the Deeds, but alſo the Counſels and Wills of Men, there can be no Liberty of Will; nor can there be any other Deed, or any other Will than that which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, which can by no means be deceived, hath foreſeen or forethought. For if things may fall out contrary to ſuch Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, and be wreſted another way, there can be no firm Preſcience of Futurities, but rather an uncertain Opinion of them; and I take it to be impious to believe this of God. Nor do I approve of that Reaſon by which ſome think themſelves able to unlooſe the Knot of this Queſtion: For they ſay that a thing is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to happen, becauſe God hath foreſeen that it will be; but rather on the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a thing is to happen, it cannot lie hid from the Divine Providence; and ſo the Neceſſity ſlides upon the other ſide, it not being neceſſary that thoſe things ſhould happen which are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, though it be ſo that thoſe things ſhould be foreſeen which are to happen: And it is juſt as if Men buſied themſelves to enquire which thing is the Cauſe of which thing, as whether Preſcience be the Cauſe of the Neceſſity of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56937:127"/>
things to come, or otherwiſe the Neceſſity of things to come were the Cauſe of Providence. But I ſhall now endeavour to evince by Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that however the Order of Cauſes may ſtand, the Event of things foreſeen is neceſſary, although Preſcience doth not ſeem to impoſe a Neceſſity upon future things to fall out. For if a Man ſit, the Opinion of him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures that he doth ſit, muſt neceſſarily be true. And again, on the contrary, if that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion be true of any one, becauſe he ſits, it is of neceſſity true that he doth ſit. In both of theſe then there is a Neceſſity lodged; for in one is the Neceſſity of Sitting, and in the other is that of Truth: But a Man doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſit becauſe the Opinion of his ſitting is true; but the Opinion is rather true, becauſe the Man did ſit before. So that although the Cauſe of Truth ariſeth from the other part, yet there is in both a common Neceſſity ſeated. Thus may we reaſon alſo concerning Providence and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Events: For if therefore becauſe things are future they are foreſeen, they are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe they are foreſeen to arrive: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it is neceſſary that things to come ſhould be foreſeen of God; or if foreſeen, that they ſhould happen: and this thing alone is enough to deſtroy the Doctrine of Free-will. But how prepoſterous a thing is it now, that the Event of temporal things ſhould be ſaid to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56937:127"/>
be the Cauſe of eternal Preſcience? For what other thing is it to imagine that God doth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee future things becauſe they are to happen, than to imagine that what hath happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been the Cauſe of God's all-ſearching Providence? Add alſo to this, that when I know that any thing is, it is neceſſary that it ſhould be. So alſo when I know that ſuch a thing ſhall come, that muſt of neceſſity arrive. Hence it therefore follows that the Event of a foreknown thing cannot be avoided. Laſtly, if any Man doth think otherwiſe of a thing than it really is, that is not only not Knowledg, but a falſe Opinion, differing far from the Truth of Knowledg. Wherefore if any thing be ſo to come that its Arrival be not certain and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, how can it be foreſeen that it will come? For as pure Knowledg is not mingled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with Falſity; ſo alſo that thing which is conceived by it, and derived from it, can be no otherwiſe than according to its Conception. And this is the Cauſe that Science abhors Lies and Falſity, and cannot be miſtaken in what it knows, becauſe it is neceſſary that every thing ſhould be ſo as that comprehends it to be. What follows then? In what manner doth God know theſe uncertain Contingencies? For if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that a thing ſhall inevitably fall out, which poſſibly may not fall out, he is deceived; but to believe or to ſpeak this, is impiouſly to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56937:128"/>
blaſpheme. But if Providence diſcerneth that ſo as things are to come; they ſhall come; ſo that he knows that many may or may not be done, what then is this Fore-knowledg, which comprehends nothing certain, nothing ſtable? Or what doth this differ from the ridiculous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination of<note n="(d)" place="margin">

Or how much doth Divine Providence differ from humane Opinion, if it make uncertain Judgments of things, as Men do, the Events whereof are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But if there can be nothing of Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in him who is the ſure Fountain of all things, the Event of thoſe things muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which he firmly did know before would happen. Whence it follows that Men have no Freedom in their Counſels and Actions; which the Divine Mind, foreſeeing all things, without
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56937:128"/>
Falſity or Error, doth ſtrongly bind, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily oblige to one Event. And if it be once granted that there is no Freedom of Will, it is very evident how great the Confuſion, and how mighty the Diſtraction will be of humane Affairs: For in vain are Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propos'd to the Vertuous and Flagitious, which have not been deſerved by any free and voluntary Motion of the Soul. And that which is now adjudged to be the moſt juſt, will be eſteemed the moſt unequal thing in the World, which is, that evil Men ſhould be puniſhed, and the good rewarded, whom their proper Will doth not incline either to Vertue or Vice, but who are by a certain Neceſſity impoſed upon Futurities, compell'd and thruſt forwards towards both. Nor would there be ſuch things as Vertue or Vice, but rather an undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mixture and Confuſion of all Rewards. And from this alſo it will follow, that ſince all Order is derived from Providence, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is left free to the Counſels and Intentions of Men, that alſo our Vices ſhall be referr'd to the Author of all Good, than which no Opinion can be more impious. And of this it will alſo be a Conſequence, that Men ſhall have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon either to hope for any thing from God, or to pray to him: For, for what ſhould any Man either hope or pray, ſince the Series and the unalterable Courſe of Deſtiny knitteth all things
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56937:129"/>
together which are deſirable? Therefore that only Commerce and Alliance which is betwixt God and Men, I mean the Liberty of Hoping and Praying, ſhall be aboliſhed, and quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. For at the juſt Price of Humility and Vertue we deſerve the ineſtimable Reward of Divine Grace: And theſe are the only Means, to wit, Hope and Prayer, by which Men ſeem to have Power to ſpeak with God, and to be advanced and joined to the inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Light, even before they obtain their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. And if Men believe that Hope and Prayer have no Power, becauſe of the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of future Events, what thing is there then by which we may be united, and may hold faſt to God the Prince and Director of all things? Wherefore Mankind muſt of neceſſity, as thou didſt ſing a little before, be diſſevered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined from its Good, and muſt ſhrink from its Beginning.</p>

                  <p>THIS is the old Complaint againſt Providence, and the Queſtion hath been much agitated and canvas'd by<note n="(f)" place="bottom">M. T. Cicero.] Videas lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Divinatione.</note> 
                     <hi>Marcus Tullius Cicero,</hi> in his Book of Divination; and thou thy ſelf haſt conſidered it much and long, and made deep Reſearches into it, but it hath not yet been diligently and thorowly determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any of you. And the Cauſe of theſe Difficulties is, that the Motions of humane Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination and Diſcourſe cannot approach to the Purity of the Divine Preſcience, which if Men would any way comprehend, there would be no doubt or ſcruple left: Which Difficulties I ſhall endeavour to clear to you, and remove, when I have explained and anſwered thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by which thou haſt been moved. For I ask why thou doſt not think the Reaſons of thoſe who attempt to ſolve this Queſtion effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſatisfactory; which becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain that Preſcience is a neceſſary Cauſe of things to come, think that Free-will is nothing hindered by Preſcience? Let me ask,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56937:130"/>
doſt thou draw an Argument of the Neceſſity of future things from any other Topick than this, that thoſe things which are foreknown cannot but come to paſs? If therefore Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg impoſeth no Neceſſity upon future things, as thou thy ſelf a little before didſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, what is it which may conſtrain the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary End of things to a certain Event? Now for Argument-ſake, that thou mayſt better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what Will follow, let us ſuppoſe that there is no Preſcience: Shall therefore, as much I mean as in that lies, thoſe things which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Free-will, be conſtrained to ſubmit to the Laws of Neceſſity?</p>
               </sp>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Let us then again ſuppoſe that there is ſuch a thing as Preſcience, but that it doth not bind things by Neceſſity; the ſame entire and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Liberty of the Will will, I think, remain. But thou wilt ſay, that although the Preſcience of things to come doth not intimate a Neceſſity of their coming, yet it is a Sign that they will neceſſarily happen. In this manner although Preſcience had never been, the Events of future things would certainly be neceſſary: For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sign ſignifieth only what a thing may be, but it doth not effect the thing which it deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Wherefore it muſt firſt be demonſtrated; that nothing happeneth but of Neceſſity, that it may appear that Preſcience is a Sign of that Neceſſity. Otherwiſe if there be no Neceſſity,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56937:131"/>
that Fore-knowledg can be no Sign of that which is not. And now it appears that this Proof is ſupported with firm Reaſon, and not by Signs and Arguments drawn from without, but from agreeing and neceſſary Cauſes. But how can it then happen, that thoſe things which are foreſeen ſhould not fall out? As if we ſhould not believe that thoſe things will happen which Providence foreknows are to come; and that we ſhould not rather think, that though they do happen, yet there is nothing in their own Nature of Neceſſity which makes them to do ſo; which thou mayſt eaſily perceive by what I ſhall ſay. We ſee many things when they are done before our Eyes; as what we ſee the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioteer do in turning and winding of his Chariot; and ſo thou mayſt imagine it is in all other things. Now is there any Neceſſity which compels theſe things to be done?</p>

                  <speaker>Bo.</speaker>
                  <p>No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, for the Working and Effect of Art were vain if all things were moved by Compulſion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>The things then which are done are under no Neceſſity that they ſhould be done; then firſt before they were done, they were to have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived without Neceſſity. Wherefore ſome things come to paſs whoſe Ends are abſolved from all Neceſſity: For I do not think that any Man will ſay this, that what is done now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was done, was not to have happened. Theſe things therefore, although foreknown,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56937:131"/>
have free Events: For as the Knowledg of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things doth impoſe no Neceſſity upon things which are now done, no more doth the Fore-knowledg of Futurities upon thoſe which are to come. But of this very thing thou mayſt ſay there is a doubt, as whether there can be any certain Prenotion of things which have no certain and neceſſary Events: for they ſeem to diſcord, ſince thou doſt think that if they be foreſeen, they muſt neceſſarily fall out; and if that Neceſſity fail, they cannot be foreſeen; and that nothing can be comprehended by Science but what is certain. And if thoſe things which are attended by no certain Event, are foreſeen as if they were certain, that would create a Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Obſcurity of Opinion, but not a ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy true Knowledg. And thou thinkeſt it not to be according to the Integrity and Manner of Science, to judg of things otherwiſe than they are. The Cauſe of which Error is, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Man knows, he thinks his Knowledg is derived from the Power and Nature only of that which is known, whilſt is quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: For every thing which is known, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended not after the Power and Force of the thing, but rather after the Faculty of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And that this may be cleared by a ſhort Example, the Sight doth one way perceive the ſame Roundneſs of a Body, and the Touch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Eye which is placed at a Diſtance
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56937:132"/>
beholds the whole together, and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it at the ſame time with its Rays: But the other cleaving and being join'd to the Orb, and moving about the Circuit, findeth out the Roundneſs by the Parts. And Man himſelf is one way looked upon by Senſe, another way by the Imagination, another by Reaſon, another by the Underſtanding; for the Senſe conſiders the Figure as it is conſtituted and directed in the ſubject Matter: The Imagination judgeth of the Figure alone without the Matter: But Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tranſcends the other, and weighs with an univerſal Conſideration the ſingle Species; but the Eye of the Underſtanding ſoareth higher, for it ſurmounteth the univerſal Bounds, and runs diſtinctly over the very ſimple Form by Purity and Subtlety of Thought. In which that is moſtly to be conſidered, that the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Power of Comprehending doth embrace the inferiour, but the Inferiour can by no means mount up to the Superiour: For the Senſe can comprehend nothing which is not of Matter, nor doth the Imagination regard the univerſal Species, nor doth Reaſon comprehend the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Form; but the Underſtanding which look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as it were from above, when it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Form, it judgeth alſo of all things which are under it, but it knows them in the ſame manner by which it comprehended the Form, which can be known to none of the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56937:132"/>
other: For it knoweth the whole of Reaſon, the Figure of the Imagination, the ſenſible Matter, neither uſing Reaſon, the Imagination, nor the Senſes; but, as I may ſay, with one Effort of Mind it bringeth all things formally within the Compaſs of its View. Reaſon alſo when ſhe looketh upon any univerſal thing, uſing neither the Imagination nor the Senſes, doth yet comprehend all imaginable and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things: For it is ſhe who defineth the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of her Conception thus: Man is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature with two Feet; which though it be an univerſal Notion, no one yet is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Man's being an imaginable and ſenſible thing, which ſhe conſidereth not by Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Senſe, but by a rational Conception. The Imagination alſo, although it deriveth its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſeeing and forming Figures from the Senſes, yet in the Abſence, and without the Uſe of the Senſes, it conſiders and comprehends all ſenſible things, not by a ſenſible, but by an imaginative way of Judging. Doſt not thou ſee then, that all things in knowing uſe rather their own proper Faculties, than the Force or Powers of thoſe things which are to be known? Nor is it unreaſonable that it ſhould be ſo; for ſince every Judgment is the Act of the Judger, it is neceſſary that every one ſhould do his own Work by the Help of his own Faculties, and not by the Aſſiſtance of foreign Power.</p>

               <p>BUT if in knowing and perceiving of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, although the Qualities objected from without may affect the Inſtruments or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the Senſes, and the Paſſion or Suffering of the Body may go before the Strength and Vigour of the acting Soul, which may call forth the Act of the Mind or Thought reſiding within it ſelf, and may in the mean time excite the Forms which lie quietly within: If, I ſay, in the perception of bodily things the Soul is not by the Impreſſion of Paſſion made to know theſe things, but by its own Power judgeth of the Paſſion and Suffering of the Body, how much more then ſhall thoſe things which are abſolved and free from the Paſſions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Bodies, and from any Commerce with them, not in diſcerning, be guided by outward Objects, but accompliſh and execute purely the Acts of their own Minds and Thoughts? By this Reaſon then there are ſeveral ſorts of Knowing, to ſeveral and differing Subſtances: For Senſe, which is alone deſtitute of all other Knowledg, is allotted to thoſe Creatures which cannot move; ſuch as are Shells of the Sea, and other things which are nouriſhed by ſticking to the Rocks. But the imaginative Power is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56937:134"/>
by Beaſts, which can move of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and who ſeem to have ſome kind of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of deſiring or refuſing things; but Reaſon is the Talent of Mankind alone, as Intelligence only appertains to the Divine Nature. Hence it is that that Knowledg exceeds all other, which by its own Nature is not only acquainted with the Matter of that which properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it, but alſo with that which is ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all others. But how will it then fall out, if Senſe and Imagination oppoſe and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reaſon, affirming that that Univerſal is nothing which Reaſon thinks it ſo perfectly ſees? For Senſe intimates that that which is ſenſible and imaginable, cannot be univerſal: Then therefore the Judgment of Reaſon muſt be true, that nothing can be ſenſible: Or elſe, becauſe ſhe knows that many things are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Senſe and Imagination, the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reaſon muſt be vain, which conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which is ſenſible and ſingular as an Univerſal. But if Reaſon ſhould again an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to thoſe things, and ſay, that ſhe truly comprehends what is ſenſible and imaginable within the Compaſs of Univerſality; but yet ſhe cannot aſpire to the Knowledg of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality, becauſe Knowledg of the former cannot exceed corporeal Figures: But as to the Knowledg of things, we ought to give Belief to the more firm and perfect Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56937:135"/>
of them. In a Conteſt of this kind therefore, ought not we who have in us all the Powers of Reaſon, Imagination, and Senſe, rather to approve and ſupport the Cauſe of Reaſon? Like this it is, when humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon imagines that the Divine Underſtanding beholdeth or knoweth not things to come, but juſt as they are beheld or known by her. For thus thou argueſt; What things do not ſeem to have certain and neceſſary Events, they cannot be foreknown certainly to happen. Of theſe things therefore there is no Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; or if we believe that there be any, then is there nothing which doth not happen of Neceſſity. If therefore we might have the Judgment of the Divine Mind, as we are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Reaſon, we ſhould judg as we have already judged, that Imagination and Senſe ought to yield to Reaſon, and alſo judg that it is moſt juſt that humane Reaſon ought to ſubmit it ſelf to the Mind of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if we may, let us advance our ſelves to the Height of the higheſt Intelligence, and there Reaſon ſhall ſee that which ſhe cannot find in her ſelf; and that is, in what manner the Preſcience of God ſeeth and defineth all things, although they have no certain Event; nor let this be looked upon as an Opinion, but rather the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Simplicity of the Supreme Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,

                  <p>BEcauſe therefore, as I have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated a little before, that every thing which is known, is not by its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture known, but by that of him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth it, let us now behold, as far as it is lawful for Philoſophers, what the Eſtate is of the Divine Subſtance, that we may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſee what this Knowledg is. It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Judgment then of all thoſe who live by the Rules of Reaſon, that God is Eternal: Let us then conſider what Eternity is, for this would lay open to us, at the ſame time, the Nature of God and his Knowledg. Eternity therefore is a total and a perfect Poſſeſſion of a Life which ſhall never have an End; which appears more clearly from the Compariſon of temporal things: For whatſoever liveth in time, proceedeth to the preſent, from what is paſt to what is to come: And there is nothing under the Laws of Time, which can at once comprehend the whole Space of its Life. For a Man doth not yet poſſeſs to Morrow; and what was Yeſterday he hath already loſt; and in the Life of this Day you live no more but as in this paſſing and tranſitory flowing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whatever therefore is ſubject to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56937:136"/>
Condition, although, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought of the World, it never began to be, nor ſhall ever have end, but its Life ſhall be drawn out to an Infinity of Time, yet it is not that which Men may rightly judg to be Eternal: for although it comprehends the Space of an infinite Life, yet it doth not embrace altogether at the ſame time; for it wants the future things which are not yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. Whatſoever then comprehends and poſſeſſes together, and at the ſame time the Fulneſs of an endleſs Life, which wants nothing of Futurity, and from which nothing that is paſt is eſcaped, ought juſtly to be eſteemed Eternal: For it is neceſſary that that ſhould always be preſent to it ſelf, and Maſter of it ſelf, and that it have always with it the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of movable Time. Therefore they err, who when they heard that <hi>Plato</hi> believed that this World neither had Beginning, nor ſhall have End, in this manner they make that which is created, Coeternal with its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: For it is one thing to be led on through an interminable Life, which <hi>Plato</hi> granted to the World, and another to comprehend at the ſame time together the Preſence of ſuch an one, which it is manifeſt is only proper to God. Nor ought it to ſeem to us that God is antienter than the created World by quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Time, but rather by the ſimple Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56937:137"/>
of his Nature. The infinite Motion of temporal things imitates the preſent State of immovable Life: and ſince it can neither coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit nor equal it, from Immobility it paſſeth into Motion; from the Simplicity of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it goeth into an infinite Quantity of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and paſt Time: And ſince it cannot toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſeſs the Fulneſs of it ſelf; yet in this, ſince it never ceaſeth in ſome meaſure to be, it ſeems faintly to emulate that, to whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it cannot attain, and which it cannot fully expreſs, binding it ſelf to ſome kind of Preſence of this ſmall and ſwift Moment; which, becauſe it bears ſome Reſemblance of that durable and preſent Time, it giveth to thoſe things to which it happens a ſeeming Exiſtence. And becauſe this ſmall Moment may not ſtay, it doth therefore proceed in the infinite way of Time. And hence it is that it continues it ſelf in Progreſſion, to the Fulneſs of which it could not attain by being fixed. If then we would, following <hi>Plato,</hi> impoſe Names ſutable to things, let us ſay, that God is only Eternal, and the World is Perpetual. Since then every Judgment comprehends thoſe things which are ſubject to it, according to its own Nature, there muſt always be allowed to God an eternal and ever preſent State: His Knowledg alſo exceeding all the Motions of Time, remaineth in the Pureneſs and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56937:137"/>
of its Preſence, containing the infinite Spaces of preſent and paſt Time, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things by the Purity of that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, as if they were now doing. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wouldſt rightly conſider of that Preſcience by which he fore-knoweth all things, thou ſhalt not eſteem it as a Fore-knowledg of what is to come, but more rightly thou wilt find it to be the Knowledg of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and never failing NOW. Therefore it is not to be called <hi>Praevidentia,</hi> but rather <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia;</hi> which being placed far above all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things, doth as it were behold all from the very Heights of the World. What is it then that thou wouldſt have, that theſe things ſhould be attended by a neceſſary Event, which are view'd by the Divine Eye, ſince Men do not make thoſe things neceſſary which they behold? For doth thine Eye which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth a preſent thing, add any thing of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to it?</p>

                  <p>But if Men do make a juſt Compariſon betwixt the Divine and Humane Preſcience, then as you ſee ſomething by your temporal one, God ſeeth all things by his eternal one. Therefore this Divine Fore-ſight doth not change the Nature and Property of things, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds thoſe things as preſent to him, which ſhall in time be produced: Nor doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Judgment of things, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56937:138"/>
at one View what is neceſſarily, and what is not neceſſarily to arrive. So you, when at the ſame time you ſee a Man walk upon the Earth, and the Sun to riſe in the Heaven, although both were ſeen at the ſame time, yet you diſcern and judg that the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the one was voluntary, and that of the other was a neceſſary one: So therefore the Eye of God looking down and beholding all things under him, doth not at all diſturb the Qualities of things, which to him are preſent, but, in reſpect of Time, to you are future. Hence it is that this is not an Opinion, but a certain Knowledg grounded upon Truth, that when God knoweth that any thing is to be, at the ſame time he knoweth it not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Neceſſity of exiſting. And here if thou ſayſt, that what God doth foreſee ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, it cannot but happen; and that which cannot do otherwiſe than happen, muſt of Neceſſity come to paſs, and ſo muſt bind me to a Neceſſity: I will confeſs that this is a moſt ſolid Truth, but it is ſuch an one that ſcarce any one can attain to, unleſs he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Mind of God. For I will anſwer thee thus; That the Thing which is to arrive, being referr'd to the Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, becomes neceſſary; but if it be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its own Nature, it ſeems altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolute and free: For there are two
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56937:138"/>
kinds of Neceſſities; one ſimple, as that it is neceſſary for all Men to die; the other is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, as if thou knoweſt any one doth walk, it is neceſſary that he do walk. What then any one knows, it cannot be otherwiſe than it is known to be: But this Condition doth not at all draw that ſimple one along with it. For its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Nature doth not conſtitute this Neceſſity, but the Addition of the Condition: For no Neceſſity compels a Man to walk, who walks voluntarily, although it muſt be neceſſary that he ſhould walk when he doth. Therefore, in the ſame manner, if Providence ſeeth any thing preſent, it is neceſſary that it ſhould be, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in its own Nature there be nothing to conſtitute that Neceſſity: but all Futurities, which proceed from Free-will, God ſees as preſent to him. Theſe things therefore, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation being had to the Divine Sight, are made neceſſary by the Condition of the Divine Knowledg; but being conſidered by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they do not recede from the abſolute Liberty of their Nature. All things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall come to paſs, which God foreſees ſhall have a Being, but many of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Free-will; which, although they do happen, yet they do not by exiſting loſe any thing of their Nature; by which it was in their Power before they did happen, not to have happened.</p>

purpoſe if things be not neceſſary in their own Nature, ſince by the Condition of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledg they fall out together, as if they lay under a Neceſſity?</p>

                  <p>This is the Difference, that thoſe things which a little before I propoſed to thee, to wit, the Sun riſing, and a Man going, which, when they are done, cannot but be done: But yet it was neceſſary that one of theſe before it was done ſhould exiſt, but it was not ſo with the other. So then thoſe things which God doth ſee at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, do without doubt exiſt; but ſome of them proceed from the Nature of things, as is inſtanced in the riſing of the Sun; and others from the Will and Power of the Doer, as it is in the other Inſtance.</p>

                  <speaker>Bo.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore I did not ſay amiſs when I ſaid, that ſome things, being referred to the Divine Knowledg, are neceſſary; but if conſidered by themſelves, they are abſolved from the Bonds of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Juſt as every thing which is an Object of the Senſes, if it be conſidered by Reaſon, it is univerſal; but if by it ſelf, it is ſingular. But thou mayſt ſay, that if it be in my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to change my purpoſe, I ſhall deſtroy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and make it to ſignify nothing, if perchance I ſhould change that which ſhe hath foreſeen.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus I will anſwer thee, That thou mayſt perchance alter thy purpoſe; but becauſe the preſent Truth of the Divine
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56937:139"/>
Providence foreſeeth that thou mayſt change it; but whether thou doſt it or not, or which way ſoever thou mayſt turn it, thou canſt not avoid the Preſcience of God; no more than thou canſt fly from the Sight of his Eye, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by the Freedom of thy Will thou doſt turn thy ſelf to never ſo great a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Actions. But what then mayſt thou ſay? Shall the Divine Knowledg be changed according to the Mutability of my Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that when I would now do that, and now do this, that alſo ſhould ſeem to vary its turns of Knowing? No certainly; for the Divine Eye foreruns all future things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns and brings them back to the Preſence of God's proper Knowledg. Nor doth he, as thou thinkeſt, change his turns of Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing, now this, now that; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains fixed, and at once foreſees and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all the Variations and Changes. Which preſent Faculty of comprehending and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things, God doth not receive from the Events of future things, but from the proper Simplicity of his own Nature. Hence alſo that is reſolved which thou didſt lay down a little before, which was, that it is unfit to be thought that our future Actions and Events are the Cauſes of the Preſcience of God: For this Strength of the Divine Mind which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth and comprehends all things with a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56937:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preſent Knowledg, hath it ſelf appointed a Method and Bounds to all things, and is not beholden to Futurities. Since then things are thus, there remains to Men an inviolable Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Will. Nor are the Laws to blame when they propoſe Rewards and Puniſhments to thoſe whoſe Wills are free from the Yoke of Neceſſity. That God alſo who foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things remains above, and the always-preſent Eternity of his Sight agreeth with the future Quality of our Actions, diſpenſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to good, and Puniſhments to evil Men. Nor are our Hopes and Prayers lodged and addreſſed to God in vain, which when they are ſincere and honeſt cannot be unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, nor without Effect. Hate Vice then, and turn from it; love, honour and adore Vertue; advance your Minds and Thoughts to the trueſt Hope, and let your humble Prayers mount on high: for there is a great Neceſſity of being good and vertuous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon you, if you will not diſſemble, ſince you act in the Sight of a Judg that ſeeth all things.</p>
